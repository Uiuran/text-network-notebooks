Foreword 
by Sogyal Rinpoche 

Here in. this book, you will read about extraordinary practitioners of meditation 
and exponents of the teachings of Buddha, about great masters whose compassion, 
understanding and capacity defy ordinary criteria, and about a world in which a 
very particular definition prevails, quite different to the one promoted all around 
us today, of what is possible to be achieved by a human being. However, you will 
not learn so much in these pages about the author of these memoirs, the Tibetan 
master Kyabje Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche. This is inevitable, because of his humility 
and his discretion. And yet he is the heart of this book, not only because it is his 
eyes witnessing these amazing events, his voice recounting them and his mind 
making sense of them for us, but also because he was of the very same caliber 
as the exceptional individuals he is describing. He inherited their wisdom com-
pletely, and he embodied their incredible qualities. Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche was, 
in fact, one of the greatest masters of meditation of the twentieth century, and one 
of the most outstanding and prolific teachers of the Dzogchen and Mahamudra 
teachings that lie at the heart of the Buddhist tradition of Tibet. 

I first met Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche when I was very young, because, as he ex-
plains in this book, he came many times to receive teachings from my master 
Dzongsar Khyentse, Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro. When, years later, I re-
quested Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche for teachings, he recalled how he had always seen 
me at the side of Jamyang Khyentse, and our mutual bond through our proxim-
ity to this great teacher gave us both a deep feeling of closeness. In the Nyingma 
and Kagyii schools of Tibetan Buddhism, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche was an im-
mensely important lineage master, and was the teacher and representative of the 
16th Gyalwang Karmapa. He also passed on transmissions to the greatest lamas 
of the Nyingma tradition, Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche and Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse 
Rinpoche. Both of them, along with Nyoshul Khenpo Jamyang Dorje and so many 
other great holders of the teachings, held Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche in the highest 
regard, as someone who had fully realized the view and practice of Dzogpachenpo, 
the Great Perfection. 

As a teacher, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche was unique, in a class of his own. One 
fact that struck you straight away was that whatever he taught was saturated with 
the flavor of Dzogchen. Of course, he possessed a complete mastery of all aspects 



X BLAZING SPLENDOR 

of the Buddhadharma; he specialized, for example, in carrying out Vajrayana 
practices with extreme precision and authenticity; he had meditated since the 
age of four and spent over twenty years of his life in retreat; and he was renowned 
as someone to whom many great masters would go for his priceless clarification 
on difficult points in the teachings. But when it came to introducing the essential, 
innermost nature of mind, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche was unparalleled. 1 remem-
ber how, at Nagi Gompa in Nepal, he would always give the pointing out mind 
instructions, introducing people to the essence of mind whenever they requested 
teachings-whether they were students of Dharma or just trekkers visiting the 
Himalayas. When people asked for the pointing out mind instructions, in one 
session, he would somehow just give them everything, the whole teaching, even 
if it was a large group of people. 1t was uncanny: he would keep on and on intro-
ducing the nature of mind, until they got it. Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche must have 
introduced thousands of.people to the Buddhadharma and allowed them to ex-
perience, if only fleetingly the innermost nature of their mind. They would come 
away from their meeting with him with a fervent inspiration to practice, and to 
pursue this new and nascent understanding of their minds by taking up the path 
of Dharma. 

On his world tour in 1980-1, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche gave precious instruc-
tions to my students in London, and in 1988, he gave the pointing out instruc-
tions to a much larger group who had traveled to Nepal to see him and Kyabje 
Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. After that, 1 endeavored to return every winter to 
Nagi Gompa to receive teachings from him. 1 count myself extraordinarily for-
tunate to have been able to do so. His teachings, which were simply amazing, 
went straight to my heart, and had a deep and powerful effect on the manner 
in which 1 taught. 1 remember well the encouragement he gave me too; it was 
he, in fact, who showed me in many ways the importance of what 1 was seeking 
to do in teaching the Dharma in the West. Everybody from the highest lama to 
the most ordinary person who knew him in Nepal, remarked on Tulku Urgyen 
Rinpoche's kindness, and in his character and his dealings with people, it is true 
that he enac::ted to the letter the spirit of 'The Way of the Bodhisattvas'-the 
Bodhicaryavatara. He possessed all the naturalness, simplicity and ease of a 
great Dzogchen yogi, and 1 believe it is no way an exaggeration to call him· a 
mahasiddha, a contemporary saint. At his cremation, the sky was clear, and the 
air above the land completely still, which the Dzogchen tantras denote marks the 
passing of someone with the greatest realization, whose practice was 'without 
attributes. As they say, the sign is that •there are no clouds in the sky above; no 
dust upon the earth below~ 



Foreword 

Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche's style of teaching was so fresh, so unpretentious and 
yet so effective. People were utterly disarmed by his warmth, his directness and 
his sincerity, the atmosphere that he seemed to conjure around him, and the way 
he would coax you, and guide you, step by step, into an experience of the nature of 
mind. He would unveil the mind essence from every possible angle; it was almost 
as if he were drilling it into you, until you had glimpsed it. And because his words 
came directly from his experience and his wisdom mind, whenever he gave the 
pointing out instructions, it was never the same. I used to reflect on how, when 
a master like Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, with his incredibly human kindness and 
grace, gives you the pointing out instructions, what he is introducing you to is 
nothing less than the wisdom mind of the buddhas. He is personally connecting 
you with the wisdom of all the masters. This is exactly what we mean when we 
speak of the extraordinary 'blessing' of the master, and his 'incomparable compas-
sion: When all is said and done, what greater kindness could there be? The master 
turns towards you the human face of the truth, as the personification of your in-
nermost nature, and in the case of Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche it was so easy to see 
how his very being communicated everything about the essence of the teachings. 
I feel that just having met a master like him means that your precious human life 
is not wasted, and has achieved its meaning and true purpose. 

Compassion, wisdom, devotion and the innermost nature of the mind-all of 
these you will read about in this book. After all, they comprise the Buddhadharma, 
and they are what we all aspire to understand, master and realize. But the place in 
which they are all drawn together, and all exhibited most perfectly, most person-
ally, most directly in front of us, is in the master, in a master such as Tulku Urgyen 
Rinpoche. When 1 think of him, it brings home what Jamyang Khyentse said in his 
striking account of who the master really is: 

It is not only at this present moment, now, that the tsaw~ lama, the root 
master, is with us. In aU his kindness, he has never been apart from us in 
any single one of our lives throughout beginningless time, because he is 
the manifestation of our mind's true nature, appearing externally in all 
kinds of guises, pure and impure, in order to help us, either directly or in-
directly. Right now, on account of all the merit we have accumulated in the 
past, he has taken on the form of our spiritual friend, and because of this 
powerful karmic connection, we have been able to meet him, he has given 
us the nectar of the profound and vast instructions, and he has enveloped 
us in his tremendous kindness. From now on too until enlightenment, he 
will never be separate from us for even a single instant.

xii BLAZING SPLENDOR 

We could be immeasurably sad now that this great master Tulku Urgyen 
Rinpoche is lost to the world, and yet, more and more, we can feel joyful, not 
only because he lives on, in our minds and deep within our hearts, 'never separate 
from us, for even a single instant: but also because he succeeded in ensuring the 
continuity of his heritage, the teachings that he embodied so completely. His sons, 
Chokyi Ny1ma Rinpoche, Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche, Drubwang Tsoknyi Rinpoche 
and Yongey Mingyur Dorje Rinpoche are all fully qualified holders of his lineage 
and his vision, each one displaying their own individual qualities, different and yet 
extraordinary, and yet each one also bearing the stamp ofTulku Urgyen Rinpoche. 
Just like him, their familiarity with mind-essence bubbles contagiously JUSt be-
neath the surface, ready to spring out at any moment. Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche had 
many wonderful western students, among them scientists and Buddhist teachers 
who are intimately involved in presenting the Dharma to the modern world. His 
beloved students, Erik and Marcia, have been a source of constant delight to so 
many people with the books, such as this, which they have created over the years, 
and I pray that they may continue, without any obstacles. 

Finally, what do they all imply, the stories and memories that you will find in 
this book? Two things. First, that spiritual realization or enlightenment is actually 
really possible, if only we dedicate ourselves to it, with consistency and with ardor. 
Second, this is not simply ancient history, a phenomenon that happened in the 
past in India or in Tibet. Thanks to masters like Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche and his 
disciples, this living tradition of wisdom and spiritual awakening continues right 
now in the present, and thanks to them, these teachings of Buddha, with their pre-
cious pith instructions, are readily available to people everywhere. 

I pray for the fulfillment of all of Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche's aspirations; may 
his emanation appear, just as wonderful and powerful as he was, if not more so, 
to rise to the challenges of this time. May his sons and his disciples continue his 
work, without the slightest obstacle, and may his magnificent vision come to pass, 
of awakening countless beings, and pointing them towards their true nature, the 
essential innermost nature of their minds! 



Introduction 

by Daniel Goleman 

Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche was among Tibetan Buddhism's greatest masters of the 
2oth century. Blazing Splendor invites us to his side ashe. looks back over a life that 
put him at the center of an unparalleled spiritual abundance. Through his unblink-
ing eyes we meet the remarkable contemplative adepts of old Tibet-as friends 
and teachers. And through the lens of his awakened awareness, we see the world 
from a fresh, eye-opening perspective. 

Like the Dalai Lama a tulku, or reincarnate master, Tulku Urgyen was among 
the most renowned and influential modern teachers in the Dzogchen (Great 
Perfection) tradition, highly instrumental in first bringing this now-popular prac-
tice to the West. 

·Blazing Splendor· -referring to the qualities of a realized master-directly 
translates the name Tulku Urgyen was given by the Karmapa, head of Tibetan 
Buddhism's Kagyu order. Blazing Splendor, his spiritual memoir, offers an inti-
mate glimpse into his remarkable reality-and a fascinating journey through a 
lost culture. In these pages we become familiar with Nangchen, his homeland and 
a kingdom of spiritual richness, a land where everyone from shepherds to kings 
were dedicated practitioners. 

The world Tulku Urgyen knew was one in which today's conventional values 
were turned upside-down: instead of fame, fortune or celebrity being the marks 
of ·success: it was inner realization that counted, one where the mark of a life 
fulfilled was leaving a spiritual legacy for others. And Tulku Urgyen was uniquely 
positioned to know-and share with us-people who inhabited this landscape of 
sacred values. Yet his message for readers is not that realization is reserved for an 
elect few, but something that each of us can move toward, no matter where we 
begin. 

A theme central to Blazing Splendor is that of terma-a sacred teaching from 
a mystical source dating back a millennium-which enriches the life and spirit of 
those who connect to it. Tulku Urgyen's stories cast a special light on these trea-
sures designed to transform us. They are jewels of our human heritage hitherto 
largely unknown in the Western world. Tulku Urgyen was the bearer of such trea-
sures, carrying them in his heart and mind over the Himalayas and then transmit-
ting them in the world beyond to thousands of people from every walk of life. 



xiv BLAZING SPLENDOR 

Blazing Splendor covers more than the years of Tulku Urgyen's life, from his 
birth in 1920 to his death in 1996; it weaves a rich tapestry from his family history, 
and from the contemplative lineages that he himself came to hold. The result is 
not just a personal memoir, but a spiritual history of Tibet itself. We hear about 
the teachers who brought the Buddhist teachings to Tibet in the 9th century, and 
the unbroken line of masters who passed its secrets on through the ages to Tulku 
Urgyen himself. 

Through Tulku Urgyen's eyes, we meet some of the most realized and genuine 
spiritual practitioners of the 2oth century Tibet. Not only was he a friend and 
personal confidant of many of the great religious figures of contemporary Tibet, 
but his relatives and ancestors were some of the most influential figures in Eastern 
Tibet over the past centuries. 

Tulku Urgyen's life spanned an exceptional period in Tibetan history; through-
out the story, an ominous drumbeat in the background heralds the coming of the 
Communists from the East, and the ultimate devastation of the Tibetan culture 
and all its richness. We get a telling, up-close look at the treachery of Lhasa politics 
during this endgame, as Tulku Urgyen tells of his days as envoy of the Karmapa 
to the Tibetan government in its last gasp. And finally, we see how the spiritual 
greatness that was once Tibet managed to resurrect itself in the world beyond, as 
Tulku Urgyen-reading ill auguries of what is to come-fled Tibet a year before 
the Dalai Lama himself. 

Blazing Splendor gives us this access in an earthy, candid and entertaining 
narrative style: Tulku Urgyen's own voice. What may be most striking is Tulku 
Urgyen's natural humility. Calling no attention to himself or his own stature, he 
lets us see the world-and a fascinating pantheon of characters-just as he does: 
with blunt, often wry, candor. 

The book's voice reflects the cozy circumstances in which this tale was first 
told-a feeling of sitting at the master's side, as Tulku Urgyen shared these chap-
ters in his life with his.closest Western students. Here they have been organized 
into a sweeping account that shares with readers a world where miracles, mystery, 
and deep insight are the order of the day-a world as reflected through the open, 
lucid quality ofTulku Urgyen's mind. 

His students; Erik and Marcia Schmidt, were moved to write this book in part 
because the unique lifestyle and culture of old Tibet was inexorably changed by the 
Communist takeover in 1959. Tulku Urgyen was widely recognized within Tibetan 
Buddhist circles as one of the most outstanding lamas to survive the tragedy of the 
Chinese takeover in Tibet. As the years take their toll, one after another of the great 
masters who were trained under Tibet's classical spiritual system have passed away. 



Introduction 

In an effort to keep the spirit of this tradition alive, the authors felt compeDcd to 
present these first-person accounts by one of the last of a dying breed. 

However miraculous many of the events related within these pages seem, recent 
scientific studies indicate such. miracles may not be the stuff of imagination. For 
example one of the more intriguing aspects of these tales relates to recent findings 
on the beneficial ways long-term meditation shapes the human brain. While these 
~tudies are still in their preliminary stage, they nevertheless have yielded several 
eye-opening results on the very meditation methods applied by the masters of 
Tulku Urgyen's lineage-particularly those undertaken during years of intensive 
retreat. 

For instance, brain imaging using functional MRI while lamas meditate on 
"boundless compassion• reveals that their brains show remarkable levels of activa-
tion in two areas: the site that generates happiness and bliss, and that for readiness 
to take action. These eight lamas had put in from 10,000 hours of practice time up 
to 6o,ooo hours, and the longer they had done so, the stronger their brain's activity 
level. While ordinary volunteers who practiced the same meditation for a month 
had 10% increases in these brain regions, the lamas had, on average, ten times 
more activity. And for some lamas, the jump was as much as So times greater. 

As William James, a founder of modern psychology, suggested in his classic 
The Varieties of Religious Experience, our experiences while we register a tem-
perature of 98.6 F may not give us the fullest account of reality. In other words, al-
ternate states of brain function-and so consciousness-might allow perceptions 
of the universe that are just not discernible trom the vantage point of everyday 
awareness. 

Religious traditions around the world offer accounts of altered realities by vi-
sionaries ranging from Meister Eckhardt and St. Teresa of Avila to Black Elk. Of 
course we don't know what altered brain activity or extraordinary states might 
have allowed such visions (and we must acknowledge our own scientific bias in 
assuming that special brain states need be involved at all), but we do know that in 
every case the visions came after years of focused spiritual efforts. And neurosci-
ence now tells us that the brain responds to sustained retraining by reshaping its 
own circuitry. 

We have yet to understand what the upper limits of basic mental functions like 
attention. visualization and memory might prove to be-for modern science is 
in its intancy in studying how training the mind can rewire the nervous system. 
On the other hand ancient spiritual traditions, like that of Buddhism in Tibet, 
have systematically urged practitioners to spend years honing their sensibilities 
through sustained training.

xvi BLAZING SPLENDOR 

What's particularly intriguing about the stories in Blazing Splendor is the sheer 
length of time put into these practices by the masters of Tibet. While the lamas 
studied in modern labs have done at least three to six years of intensive retreat, it 
seems to have been routine for masters ofTulku Urgyen's generation to have done 
three or four times that amount. Tulku Urgyen himself, for example, appears to 
have spent more than 20 years in intensive retreat, as was true of his late peer, the 
great Dilgo Khyentse. But some of the masters who lived their entire life in Tibet 
often did even more: Tulku Urgyen's father put in 33 years of meditation retreat 
over the course of his life. 

Science has now verified how powerful just three years of retreat can be in 
sharpening mental faculties. We can only guess what 20 or 30 years might do. 
From that perspective, we might do weU to suspend our judgments about the 
seeming ·miraculous· powers routinely ascribed to these Tibetan masters of the 
past. Who knows what might be possible for a mind so highly and exquisitely 
trained? 

What might be possible remains further obscured by another element of 
Buddhist tradition, the remarkable humility about their own achievements that 
marks many highly accomplished practitioners. Thus Tulku Urgyen himself. who 
was venerated as a teacher by many of the most revered masters of his day (includ-
ing the 16th Karmapa), repeatedly asserts that he is nothing special-just an or-
dinary person. This humble stance has another wrinkle: Tulku Urgyen's line holds 
to the tradition of the •hidden yogis; who routinely camouflage their spiritual 
attainments. Western readers, unaccustomed to this strong tradition of humility 
about one's spiritual stature, might misread its signs, inferring instead an absence 
of accomplishment rather than its veiled presence. 

The reader confronts yet another dilemma: how to regard the many matter-
of-fact accounts of what, from a modern mindset,.are improbable or impossible 
events, even miracles. Some readers may simply dismiss them as embellishments, 
while others choose to take them all at face value, or to set aside a dismissive criti-
cism for the time being-or simply being open to their possibility without coming 
to any firm judgment. 

For those steeped in the assumptions of rationality, these events are enigmatic, 
raising questions that cannot be readily answered. Are these accounts mere leg-
ends and folktales? Are they recounted as metaphors or teaching stories whose 
details or veracity are less important than the point they make? Did some of these 
seemingly impossible events actually occur only in the mind of those who tell of 
them? Or could it be they partake of a range of experience beyond the everyday 
•trance· created by our thoughts and fantasies, memories and daydreams? 



Introduction xvii 

Each of us will have to decide for ourselves. But all of us stand to benefit richly 
in expanding the horizons of our own spiritual aspirations. 

A note to readers: 
I would urge the serious reader to take the time to go through the endnotes 

as you read along. Much rich context, detail and explanation will be found in the 
notes and the glossary, which in themselves could stand as a partial tutorial in the 
Vajrayana tradition of Buddhism. Reading the notes will make the narrative itself 
much richer. And for those new to this perspective, the notes offer an essential 
background, bringing clarity where otherwise there could be some confusion.

Preface 

This is not a traditional narrative of an enlightened master's life in the Tibetan 
Vajrayana tradition. In fact, Tulku Urgyen rarely if ever spoke much about himself 
or his accomplishments. At most he occasionally might tell a 'teaching story' from 
his past in order to convey a specific point to a particular person at a particular 
time. He would only mention details about his life when urged, and so this memoir 
results from Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche telling us stories about his life at our request, 
over a period of fourteen years. 

From these tales we've strung a storyline, piecing together vignettes he told at 
different times, much like beads on a rosary. The resulting mosaic offers a rich 
narrative of Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche's tradition and ancestors, tales of masters 
he knew or heard about, and many details of his life. We cannot claim that Tulku 
Urgyen Rinpoche wrote this, as he did not set out to narrate an autobiography. He 
simply responded to our requests by telling these stories, and he did so only after I 
promised that the main emphasis would be not on himself, but on the remarkable 
people he met or was connected to through other masters. 

When I asked him about the contents, he replied: ·Just stick to the stories. 
Don't fill it with photos of me. In Kham we call that self-aggrandizement. Include 
many photos of realized lamas, but there's no need to include common people. 
Sacred places are very good too. It is beneficial for people to see sacred places like 
Bodhgaya if they haven't been there themselves!" 

He also gave a suggestion for a title: ·oevotional summary of the life-examples 
of sublime masters!" 

I feel we have stayed true to that spirit. 
In the course of looking for the thread that tied everything together one theme 

became paramount and that is the vital continuity of lineage. As the reader will 
see, the New Treasures-the revelations ofTulku Urgyen Rinpoche's great-grand-
father-and the transmission from one generation to the next play an important 
role in this book. And in the end all streams of transmission converge in the ocean 
of the supreme incarnation.' The teller of these tales was such an incarnation. 
•Blazing Splendor• is a mystical adventure story, a journey into eras, places, and 
situations unlike anything most of us have experienced. At the same time, it is a 
down-to-earth, human story, vividly told and, at times, heart-wrenching. 



Preface xix 

Tulku Urgyen's narrative tells of remarkable accomplishments of the human 
spirit, supported at times by divine intervention. It is no fairy tale, yet it is re-
plete with magic and epic triumphs of wondrous magnitude. It describes spiritual 
achievement at its best-and human folly at its worst. Tibetans will find this biog-
raphy unlike most others in their traditional genre, for it fails to mention almost 
any of the important details of this master's life, his miraculous feats and his ex-

traordinary level of realization. Western readers may find that many of the stories 
seem to be sheer fiction or at least demand the suspension of their critical attitude. 
Yet what is presented, though at times challenging to normal conventions and 

perceptions, is for the most part verifiable. 

Nobody could tell an anecdote like Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche. Not only could 

he perfectly recall tales told him as a child long ago and repeat them verbatim; 
he could invite you into his memory's landscape and describe exactly what took 

place in vivid detail, as if casting a spell. He offers events and conversations with a 

captivating emotional depth that transports us into his experience. 
Still, in an odd way, this memoir is not really about Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, 

his incredible works or his legendary special teaching style, which could ignite the 
listener's hidden potential for attaining liberation and complete enlightenment. 

Rather, it shares with the reader what he witnessed and, perhaps most profound, 

how he perceived his world. 

And what a world Tibet was before the communist invasion! In that world, sa-

cred exploits were the yardstick of success. Love and appreciation of the great gift 
of the Buddha's teachings and for the masters who upheld those teachings were 

paramount. That was a legacy even the communists could not destroy; it was car-

ried far and wide in the hearts of those who escaped the wanton destruction and 
devastation of their culture. Blazing Splendor recounts their fortitude-a victory 
of the strength of mind in the face of overwhelming odds. 

The main themes that permeate Tulku Urgyen's story are the depth of ven-

eration of the Buddhist teachings, their preservation and dissemination through 

unbroken lines of transmission, unfaltering courage in following one's teacher's 

commands, the unparalleled respect that masters had for one another, and the 

inescapable impermanence of any situation. 

The inconceivable damage that took place in Tibet cannot be denied or ignored. 
History bears witness to what happened. Yet, out of that devastation many pre-
cious masters and teachings survived. And the fact that these teachers were forced 
into exile has meant that those of us born into materialistic cultures can meet with 
this extraordinary tradition. 



XX BLAZING SPLENDOR 

So, we invite you to enter a world that once was and glean the atmosphere. Let 
your heart open and connect with the sublime. Don't get lost in the details of place 
and time; just experience the spiritual ambiance. And, to be sure, deep meaning 
interweaves these pages-heart advice and spiritual teachings that just might set 
you on your own personal spiritual quest. 

We offer this all to you with unimpeded love and devotion for our amazing 
teacher and with the heartfelt aspiration that you will be greatly benefited in both 
the short and the long term. 

In telling his story, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche placed the greatest emphasis on a 
landscape of people rather than physical places. Those people who inspired him 
most emerged as the main focus for this book. We have used the sequence of his 
spiritual ancestry and his life as the thread for these wonderful stories, each a jewel 
of timeless value strung together by Rinpoche's memory. We present this garland 
of tales here for you to savor.

Prologue 

Since you have asked so many times, I will tell a bit about my life. In our Tibetan 
tradition, we begin a life story by tracing back one's family to its origins. My family 
name is Tsangsar. My other name, as I am considered a reincarnation of a yogi, is 
Chowang Tulku. 

I was born in Central Tibet, taken to Kham, then went back and forth between 
the two several times.' I fled the communists to Sikkim and finally moved to Nepal, 
where I am now living as an old man. That's my life in a nutshell. 1 haven't accom-
plished any great deeds. Mostly it's just one sad event after another. 

Whenever I tell a story, I always avoid the two shortcomings of exaggeration 
and denigration-neither adding any extra qualities that someone does not pos-
sess nor refusing to acknowledge qualities that are truly present. As I am not the 
type of person who remembers specific dates, don't look for any clear chronology 
here. 

I can, however, tell you some of the stories I have heard, many of which come 
from my grandmother. 





Part One 

Spiritual Roots

Grandmother's Mission 

As my grandmother, Konchok Paldron, supervised the loading of her yaks for the 
long, hard journey from Kham to Lhasa, she was in a hurry. She was an elderly 
woman now, and too much time had already gone by since she had last seen her 
son, who was living in Central Tibet-a two-month journey. She was determined 
to start searching for him. 

My grandmother made her feelings very clear, lamenting: •My father was 
Chokgyur Lingpa, the great revealcr of hidden treasures,, and no matter where he 
went, people gathered around him like iron filings around a magnet. During my 
father's short life, his fame and glory, his influence and the number of his disciples 
seemed to surpass even those of the eminent Karmapa. Yet for all that, he left his 
body behind and me along with it. 

·Then my mother and brother passed on, too. Everyone I love has abandoned 
me. Who could be more cheerless than a lost orphan like me? Even my youngest 
child, Tersey Tulku, has discarded me to stay with his illustrious master in Central 
Tibet. People say he is unfurling the four enlightened activities among the nobles 
in Lhasa.• Even the king of Bhutan caters to him-the king gave my Tersey so 
many presents that fifty pack animals were needed to carry them. He nurtures a 
flock of eight hundred disciples-but he leaves me, his mother, all alone here in 
I<ham. 

·The travels of my father, Chokgyur Lingpa, were like a wave sweeping through 
the land, pulling everyone in its wake, no matter how learned or accomplished 
they might be. And no matter what school they belonged to, all the masters of his 
time received his teachings. Having witnessed such greatness, how can 1 be im-
pressed by anything these days? I hear all kinds of stories about the so-called great 
deeds ofTersey Tulku, yet compared to the activities of his grandfather, they seem 
no more than foam on water. 



4 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

·And now here I am, Chokgyur Lingpa's only remaining child, all alone. Tears 
have flowed from my eyes day and night, so that my pillow is moist with tears. I 
feel that all things beautiful and positive are no more than flowers in an autumn 
meadow-they are splendid but don't last long:' 

What triggered my grandmother's outburst? Uncle Tersey was extremely 
learned in her father's tradition of the New Treasures, the forty thick volumes of 
teachings revealed by Chokgyur Lingpa. From an early age, Tersey had had many 
visions and received prophecies, but, being a ·hidden yogi,• one who never flaunts 
his accomplishments or realization, he rarely spoke of them. 

One day, Uncle Tersey left Kham to go on pilgrimage. A very strong man, he 
carried his own provisions on his back, unlike most travelers in the steep terrain 
of Tibet. He didn't have a single pack animal, just two trusted attendants, each car-
rying a backpack of their own. They traveled everywhere, even to the holy places 
in India. It was during this pilgrimage that he became a disciple of the illustrious 
Shakya Shri. s 

Word reached Kham that •the bearded Tersey Tulku was living the untrou-
bled life of a lama-yogi,• and the stories were quite impressive. But none of this 
fooled my grandmother, who always responded to such news with •That too will 
pass!• 

And she began to worry about her youngest son. •I can't sleep as long as he is 
floundering about Central Tibet; she said, •I must go fetch him. He is my youngest 
and the reincarnation of my brother who met an early death. Tersey has stayed in 
Central Tibet too long. If he won't return to Chokgyur Lingpa's seat to assume his 
responsibilities, 111 have to go and bring him back myselfl• 

Since they couldn't let their elderly mother travel the long journey to Central 
Tibet alone, her three eldest sons had to prepare to accompany her. 

Our family eventually found Uncle Tersey at Kyipuk, where Shakya Shri had 
lived and taught. When they asked him to return with them to Kham, he replied, 
·sure, I'll come back, but first I must finish my pilgrimage:' Five years passed be-
fore they were all able to return home to Kham. 

It was during this journey that I was born. 

My grandmother was a very self-assured lady. It was from her that I heard most 
of the tales that I will tell here. My uncle Samten Gyatso had said several times, 
·Mother has so many stories to tell.· And she sure did! 

This remarkable lady never forgot anything; she was able to discuss events from 
long ago as though they had just taken place. People often wondered how such an 



Grandmother's Mission 

old lady could be so lucid. She could give a detailed explanation on any topic that 
piqued my curiosity, and she knew an incredible number of interesting tales. 

I adored spending time with her. 1 was especially fond of stories about her 
father, Chokgyur Lingpa, many of which never found their way into his official 
biography.' She accompanied her father, the terton, on many of his journeys and· 
saw with her own eyes what happened. She also knew many of his visionary ex-
periences and personally witnessed many of the termas being revealed. With 
her virtually perfect recall, she could give an impeccable eyewitness account of 
the whole event. Whenever she told a story, it sounded as if she were still right 
there.

Tibet, a Buddhist Land 

The Buddha's teachings were transmitted to the people of Tibet with the patron-
age of an ancient lineage of kings. It is said that a semi-divine being from the 
Punjabi royal lineage, who had descended to live among human beings, fled north 
into the Himalayas. Eventually, he emerged from the high mountains and entered 
the Yarlung region of Tibet. The people of the area believed he was a miraculous 
being who had fallen from the sky, and they carried him on oxen yokes placed on 
their shoulders to crown him as their first monarch. For this reason he became 
known as King Nyatri, the ·yoke-throned· king. 

The first Buddhist scriptures miraculously arrived in the Land of Snow after 
thirty-five generations of these kings had ruled in an unbroken line from fa-
ther to son. At that time, everyone was illiterate, a fact that filled the reigning 
king with sorrow. He prayed fervently to end his people's ignorance. Due to 
the blessings of the buddhas, three scriptures of the enlightened ones fell from 
the sky, landing on the roof of his palace. Although no one could read them, 
the mere presence of these sacred texts transformed the environment so that 
harvests were plentiful and the evil forces in the country were somewhat paci-
fied. It was as though the dense darkness of night had been broken by dawn's 
first glimmer. 

Five generations later, Songtsen Gampo took the throne and invited the first 
Buddhist teachers to Tibet. Through his enormous merit, he managed to acquire 
two of the three main statues located in the temple in Bodhgaya, the place of the 
Buddha's enlightenment in India. These statues were brought to Tibet as bridal 
gifts from the two foreign princesses he married. One statue accompanied the 
daughter of the Chinese emperor, while the second statue was brought by the 
daughter of the king of Nepal. To continue the analogy, the period of Songtsen 
Gampo's reign was like the first sliver of the rising sun illuminating the morning 
sky. The Dharma was beginning its spread throughout the land. 



Tibet, a Buddhist Land 

After another five generations King Trisong Deutsen 
made a great vow to fully establish Buddhism through-
out Tibet, and this was like the sun finally rising high in 
the sky. During his reign, he invited 108 great masters to 
Tibet from their native countries, mainly India. In those 
days, spiritual guides, teachers, and masters were called 
panditas; learned scholars. Those who received the 
teachings and translated them into Tibetan were called 
lotsawas, translators. 

The first important master invited to Tibet during this period was the re-
nowned Khenpo Bodhisattva, also known as Shantarakshita. The king had grand 

plans to build a group of temples in Central Tibet, the complex that today is 
known as Samye. But a powerful naga spirit loathed the bodhisattva, saying, 
·u these Indians start bringing Buddhism here, we will suffer. Let's all gang up 
and make trouble.• All the eight classes of spirits agreed to try their best to stop 
Buddhism from spreading in Tibet by preventing the construction of Samye. 
Whatever was built during the daytime the gods and demons of the land de-
stroyed that night. 

Now, Shantarakshita was a great bodhisattva with a tremendously loving and 
peaceful heart. But because of his peaceful nature, he was unable to subjugate the 
local spirits around Samye. It seemed Shantarakshita was going to fail in his mis-
sion so the king became increasingly depressed by the lack of progress. 

·rm only a bodhisattva; Shantarakshita told him. ·1 can't handle all the power-
ful spirits of this region. But don't despair; there is a way. In India lives a being who 
is exceptional in every way. He was not even born from a human womb; his name 
is Padmasambhava, the Lotus-Born. Any gods or demons who oppose the true 
teachings become terror-stricken and powerless simply from hearing his name. 
Invite him to Tibet, and our problems will end.• 

:·How can we invite him?· the king asked.

SPIRITUAL RooTs 

The Indian bodhisattva replied, ·we 
three share a vow from our former lives, 
when Your Majesty, Padmasambhava, and 
I were brothers who helped erect the great 
stupa in Boudha, Nepal.? Since we vowed at 
that time to spread Buddhism to the north, 
the Lotus-Born master will certainly ac-
cept our invitation; we need only ask him 
to come:' 

Padmasambhava possessed tremendous 
power, enough to subjugate all evil forces. 
Being the single embodiment of the activ-
ity of the buddhas, he was able to convert 
disciples in the dark country of Tibet as well 

as subjugate all the hostile forces . Because of his mystical proficiency, the temple 
complex of Samye was finally erected. 

Other legendary masters who helped establish the Dharma in Tibet includ-
ed Vimalamitra, who was said to have attained the extraordinary ·vajra body of 
great transformation; beyond the reach of birth and death. There was the Tibetan 
translator Vairotsana, himself an emanation of a buddha. All together, 108 pandi-
tas arrived in Tibet. • 

A great number of Tibetans were educated as translators during this period, 
so that the entire body of the Buddhist teachings, including numerous sadhana 
practices detailing entire spiritual paths, were translated into Tibetan and accu-
rately codified. · 

During the reign of Trisong Deutsen, auspicious conditions occurred in Tibet. 
The king himself was an emanation of the great bodhisattva Manjushri, and some 
of his ministers were said to be divine emanations, as were the masters and pan-
ditas invited to Tibet and even the translators of that time. Due to these incred-
ibly positive circumstances, the king was able to fulfill his vow of establishing 
Buddhism in Tibet. 

The teachings from that remarkable period are now known· as the Nyingma, or 
the Old School of the Early Translations, as opposed to the teachings imported 
from India during subsequent centuries, which are called the Sarma, or the New 
Schools of the Later Translations. 

But all did not go smoothly. A while after King Trisong Deutsen's death, there 
was a period of religious persecution, in which the evil oppressor Langdarma, 
who had become king, almost succeeded in eradicating Buddhism. But a subse-



Tibet, a Buddltist Land 

quent revival saw the beginning of the Sarma schools, introduced chiefly by the 
great translators Rinchen Zangpo and Marpa. These two-and many other great 
teachers-journeyed all the way to India, received instructions from the Buddhist 
masters there, and brought them back to Tibet. One of the kings of this early pe-
riod, a great religious ruler named Ralpachen, a grandson ofTrisong Deutsen, also 
invited many masters to Tibet. 

-Now, at that time there were two Sanghas, consisting of the congregation of 
ordained monks, recognized by their shaven heads and Dharma robes, and the 
congregation of ngakpas, tantric practitioners distinguished by their long braided 
hair, white skirts and striped shawls. As a sign of his deep appreciation for these 
two congregations, the king would spread his two very long braids out upon the 
ground, and allow the revered practitioners to tread on and sit upon his own hair. 
He would even take pebbles from under their feet and place them on the crown of 
his head to show respect. The royal patronage, in conjunction with the king's great 
reverence for the teachings, created the circumstances for Buddhism to firmly 
take root and flourish in Tibet. 

Finally, the Dharma was fully established throughout the country. Over the 
centuries, through the support of such devoted kings and the efforts of all these 
masters and translators, eight distinct lineages of teachings translated from their 
sources in India came to flourish in Tibet.' These eight schools are all, without a 
single exception, the teachings of the Buddha. Each taught without any conflict 
both the Sutra system, which includes Hinayana and Mahayana, and the system of 
Tantra which is Vajrayana.•o 

During these two periods of the first flourishing of Dharma in Tibet, masters 
and disciples-and even the disciples' disciples-attained a profound level of re-
alization. Some displayed extraordinary signs of their accomplishment, such as 
soaring like flocks of birds through the sky. Wherever they took flight and wherev-
er they landed, they left footprints in solid rock. This is not just a legend from the 
past; these imprints are visible even today, so you can go and look for yourself. 

Such was the country where I was born.

Gampopaand 
the Early Barom Masters 

As I mentioned, according to the Tibetan tradition of storytelling. a person should 
not simply appear out of nowhere. The tale should begin with the person's origins. 
We describe origins in two ways: family tree and spiritual lineage. So I will begin 
in the proper way, by telling you a bit about my family, who were often known by 
the lofty-and somewhat exaggerated-title ·divine bloodline of Tsangsar.· Our 
clan was for many centuries the rulers of two kingdoms: Tsangsar and Nangchen. 
According to oral history, our bloodline traces back to India. The story goes that a 
celestial being from the Brahma realm descended to earth to produce a child with 
a tigress in the Forest of Black Sandalwood in northern lndia.11 

These are unusual ancestors, but we are not unique in this: tradition holds that 
the first person in the Drigung family line was fathered by a god, while the mother 
was a goat. The goat gave birth to a boy and his divine father then returned from 
the heavens to collect his child. But as he picked up the boy, the goat mother, 
heartbroken at losing her child, let out a •Baaahhhhh!• and out of compassion the 
god let her keep the child. 

My ancestors are deeply connected to a spiri-
tual lineage called Barom, one of the early Kagyu 
schools. n The word Kagyu means the teachings 
(ka) that are transmitted (gyu) in an unbroken 
lineage from the very beginning until today. It is 
said that this spiritual lineage traces a continu-
ous line back to the celestial buddha Vajradhara, 
whose teachings passed through the Indian mas-
ters 1ilopa and Naropa and then to their Tibetan 
successors Marpa and Milarepa. The famous yogi 
Milarepa had many disciples, but there is one who 
rose to the fore; today we know him as Gampopa, 



Gampopa and the Early Barom Masters 11 

•the man from Gampo; the root of our Barom 
tradition. 

Before he met Milarepa, Gampopa had 
studied and practiced the Buddha's teachings 
for quite a while and had reached proficien-
cy in the meditative state of samadhi. One 
day, a beggar happened by and began talking 
about Milarepa, a great guru, right outside 
Gampopa's window. The moment Gampopa 
heard Milarepa's name, he was overcome with 
emotion and called the beggar inside. 

1. 
Gampopa-the 
forefather of the 

·Where does this Milarepa liver he asked. L-------------' Kagyu masters 

The beggar told the master's life story: how he had been wronged as a child by 
his own relatives and suffered, how he mastered black magic and used it to take 
revenge, then how he had a change of heart, became a renunciate, and was now 
an amazing master yogi. The beggar ended by saying, •Right now he lives in the 
province ofNgari. I am one of his disciples:" 

·eould I meet him?· asked Gampopa. 
·or course; replied the beggar. 
Gampopa felt a deep yearning to meet this yogi, and, wasting no time, the very 

next morning he headed for Ngari. He met Milarepa at a place named Auspicious 
Ridge. Upon merely seeing the master's face, Gampopa attained the warmth of 
blissful emptiness. Milarepa told him, ·sit down and train in tummo!· -the yoga 
of inner heat. After a short time of practice, as you can read in the Life of Milarepa, 
he showed profound signs of progress connected with the energy currents dissolv-
. ing into the central channel.', 

When Gampopa had gained a highly refined level of insight into Mahamudra, 
the awakened state of mind, his guru said, ·You have spent enough time with me. 
You must now go to Mount Dakpo and practice in solitude, but before you leave I 
still have one final lesson for you:" 

On the day of departure, Milarepa walked with Gampopa for some distance. 
After he rested a while on a large boulder, it was time for the final good-bye. 
Then Milarepa stood up, lifted his yogi's skirt and showed Gampopa his but-
tocks. They were so worn down and callused that Gampopa could almost see 
the bones. 

•Listen to me! When training in Mahamudra, do not busy yourself with virtuous 
deeds of body and speech; Milarepa explained, ·because you risk losing thought-
free wakefulness. It was by sitting on these buttocks that I attained realization. I

have persevered in the two paths of means and liberation: Naropa's Six Doctrines 
and Mahamudra. Easy, comfortable practice won't get you anywhere! 

"Forsake the aims of this life,· he continued. "Practice with fortitude. One day, 
you will see this old father as a buddha in person. That is when genuine realization 
of Mahamudra will have taken birth in you. This is my final instruction~ 

Gampopa went to stay in a small meditation hut on Mount Dakpo, where he 
trained with tremendous perseverance, unconcerned with life or limb. Through 
this effort, his insight deepened until he realized the awakened state that is bound-
less like the sky. Gradually his following grew vast; five hundred of his disciples 
became masters in their own right, allowed to bear the parasol of the Dharma, 
signifying their status as lords of the Buddha's teachings-no small position. Thus 
he fulfilled the prediction of Naropa, who said, "My disciples will be more emi-
nent than their teacher, but their disciples will be even more eminent." And sure 
enough, the practitioners who sprung from his lineage were as numerous as flocks 
of birds taking flight and filling the sky. L4 

Among Gampopa's foremost disciples was a man named Darma Wangchuk, 
who is counted as the first master of the Barom lineage. From early childhood he 
had no other thought than practicing the Buddha's sacred teachings; as he grew 
up, his sole aim was to find the best master to follow. 

Eventually, the young Darma Wangchuk met a yogi and asked where he was 
headed. 

"I'm going to Mount Dakpo, where the extraordinary Gampopa lives~ 
"Take me with you-I want to meet him too!" exclaimed Darma Wangchuk, hav-

ing made up his mind that very moment. Off they went. Upon meeting Gampopa, 
Darma Wangchuk immediately became his disciple. 

Where I come from, the word 'disciple; is not used lightly. It means someone 
who practices full-time, who gives up everything to focus one-pointedly on attain-
ing enlightenment in that same body and lifetime. People who merely received a 
few empowerments or a short teaching now and then were not necessarily count-
ed as disciples. . 

Darma Wangchuk became the prime example of the kind of disciple who serves 
his master perfectly in thought, word, and deed. He even saved Gampopa's life 
several times. 

We Tibetans are in the habit of showing our religious fervor by pushing one 
another aside to get close to the lama and receive blessings. It can become quite a 
scene, almost a stampede. Once, at a big market fair, word spread that Gampopa 



Gampopa and the Early Barom Masters 

was there, and so everyone at the fair wanted to obtain his blessings-all at the 
same time, nearly crushing the master. Darma Wangchuk must have been quite 
a strong man because, the story goes, he lifted Gampopa on his back and carried 
him to safety. 

Another time Gampopa and his following were moving along a steep, narrow 
trail i~ the high mountains. The yak Gampopa was riding slipped and fell into the 
~byss. But Darma Wangchuk was quick enough to catch hold of Gampopa and 
thereby saved his life. 

One day, Gampopa told Darma Wangchuk, ·You have served me for a long time 
and with great devotion. Now the time has come for you to benefit others. Go to 
the north, to a cave on sacred Mount Kangsar, and devote yourself one-pointedly 
to meditation practice:' Gampopa then described the mountain and how to get 
there. Darma Wangchuk pleaded with him, saying that he would rather remain a 
humble servant, but Gampopa sent him off just the same. 

Darma Wangchuk went where he was told and practiced with great diligence, 
having completely turned his back on striving for food, clothing or fame. The gods 
and spirits of the mountain brought him provisions, and he stayed there for thir-
teen years. At the end of his retreat, he could fly through the sky and move freely 
through solid rock, and he had the signs of an accomplished master. 

Darma Wangchuk established his first center in Central Tibet,'5 near Mount 
Kangsar, northeast of Lhasa, where he had spent all those years. An increasing 
stream of faithful people with offerings, some coming all the way from China, be-
gan to find their way there. But after an avalanche buried his temple, he accepted 
an invitation from the king of Nangchen in eastern Tibet. There he established 
his second monastery, and over the generations the kingdom slowly became filled 
with meditators and yogis. 

The word 'meditator' in my homeland of Nangchen is closely connected with 
the pointing-out instruction of Mahamudra, the most profound teaching in the 
Barom lineage. Almost everyone living in Nangchen received this instruction, 
which directly introduces the state of realization, and so they all became medita-
tors. On every mountainside, in every valley, each family's house became a prac-
tice center. At the end of the day. even simple water-bearers used the leather straps 
on their yokes as meditation belts, as did shepherds with the ropes from their 
slingshots. It is said that almost everyone was a practitioner, and so the kingdom 
got the name Gomde, the Land of Meditators, a sign that the Buddha's teachings 
had firmly taken root there. '6 

In modern times, people often wonder why so many spiritual practitioners 
spent year after year in remote mountain dwellings. The answer is simple: They 

13 



14 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

had an acute awareness of the grave facts of life-that we are mortal, that time is 
running out for each of us, and that we can use this precious life to secure a lasting 
attainment of liberation and enlightenment. 

They saw worldly success and social recognition, even in dreams at night, as 
nothing but demonic attempts to seduce us away from the attainment of enlight-
enment. Seeing mundane pursuits as the futile chasing of a mirage, they removed 
themselves from the world like a wounded deer recovering from an injury, until 
they attained stability in the awakened state. Having attained the perfect stabil-
ity of enlightenment, the masters among them engaged in work for others, by 
establishing monastic centers where the Buddha's teachings could be practiced 
and passed on. 

It's amazing what a single authentic spiritual master can accomplish in terms 
of the common good. When you have the chance, try to read the biographies of 
the early Buddhist masters and the original founders of the major monasteries in 
Tibet. See how they went off and practiced with great dedication, and how they 
later built magnificent temples for the benefit of others. If you could have seen 
the number of beautiful statues of exquisite craftsmanship that existed before the 
communist destruction-gilded with the offerings of devoted people and created 
for over a thousand years-you would be quite impressed. Yet every single found-
er of this exquisite abundance had been a true renunciate, while regarding worldly 
honor and success as an attack by demonic forces. 

The spiritual influence of a single enlightened being can spread into every cor-
ner of human civilization. There have been innumerable examples of this over the 
centuries. For instance, before he built the temple complex at Tsurphu in Central 
Tibet, where the Dharma flourished for centuries, the first Karmapa had already 
spent decades in meditation sheltered by nothing more than the overhang of a 
cliff. But there came a time when he reached such a level of realization that there 
were abundant signs of extremely high spiritual attainment.17 

Like the Karmapa, there have been thousands upon thousands of practitioners 
who followed Milarepa's example. When someone stayed in an unpopulated valley 
or a remote cave, having abandoned futile involvements, and thereby had the time 
to awaken to true enlightenment-now, that impresses me! 

My family became linked to these early Barom Kagyu teachers through the 
master Tishi Repa, one of Darma Wangchuk's main disciples. TIShi Repa had four 
other gurus as well, and in their honor he fashioned a famous hat with five peaks-
one at the center and one in each of the four directions.'' 



Gampopa and the Early Barom Masters 15 

In Tishi Repa's time, a tradition of spiritual relationship between China and 
Tibet had begun whereby the Chinese emperors sought out and invited the 
most eminent Tibetan master to be the imperial guru. At regular intervals, a 
search party was sent to travel throughout Tibet to find the greatest master of 
the day. As his fame had spread far and wide, the lama with the five-peaked hat 
received an invitation from the emperor. That's how he became known as Tishi 
Repa-_tishi being the Chinese title for the imperial preceptor, the highest reli-
gious rank. Below a tishi were two masters of the pakshi rank, and below each 
pakshi were two dignitaries with the position known asgoshir. The tishi position 
also included an entourage of forty religious officials, all paid from the emperor's 
coffers. 

While perusing the archives during my stay at Tsurphu, the main seat of the 
Karmapas,l came across ancient correspondence with China. A similar invitation 
from the imperial court to become a tishi was once sent to the third Karmapa. In 
those days, an invitation sounded more like a command. 

One of the letters read: •To the west, no lama has been found to surpass you in 
spiritual qualities. The emperor has established this fact through his many emis-
saries. You alone must now be the imperial preceptor. If you fulfill his wish and 
come 'to China, the emperor will bestow every boon upon you in both spiritual 
and secular affairs. If you fail to fulfill the emperor's wish, you will never have an-
other happy day:' 

Along with the document came a large seal of pure gold, a sign of exalted rank. 
Two high-ranking officials had personally carried the invitation to Tsurphu. The 
letter continued, ·commence your journey to China immediately, together with 
these two officials. Unnecessary delay of departure, even for a single day, will re-
sult in dire consequences:' 

Such an •invitation• required Tishi Repa to go to China-he simply had no 
choice. But he did so in a highly unusual manner. Perhaps he knew intuitively that 
traveling in the style of a grand master of Tibetan Buddhism would cost him his 
life or perhaps it was simply a personal choice, but he chose to dress as a wander-
ing beggar. 

•That attire is entirely inappropriate; the Chinese officials objected. ·wrule 
traveling on imperial command, you must proceed in a dignified manner with the 
proper pomp and circumstance befitting a grand lama:' 

They negotiated back and forth, until it was agreed that the traveling party of 
the grand lama, including his own retinue of forty religious officials, would travel 
all the way to China in the traditional way. Tishi Repa, however, was permitted to 
accompany the caravan on foot dressed as a beggar in a simple cotton robe and 



16 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

carrying only a wooden walking staff. He walked the entire distance from Kham to 
the distant Chinese capital while everyone else rode on horseback. · 

There are written accounts of the miracles and other signs of accomplishment 
Tishi Repa displayed at the imperial court. But he also saw that the emperor's dy-
nasty, which was of Mongolian descent, would last no more than thirteen years. 
When ten of those years had passed, TlShi Repa thought it best not to be in the 
capital when the dynasty fell, and so he made excuses to leave. But the imperial 
family categorically refused to let him return to Kham. 

"Times are taking a turn for the worse; Tishi Repa thought. "The emperor's life 
is running out, and if I stay I will get caught up in warfare and internal strife. I must 
escape by stealth:' 

And so he slipped away. When the emperor discovered that Tishi Repa had fled, 
he sent out search parties in all directions. After two or three days, they caught 
up with him, and under strict guard Tishi Repa was marched back to the imperial 
court, where the emperor kept the master under lock and key. 

"How will imprisoning me help you?" Tishi Repa asked. "You are the ones who 
are in trouble! Three years from now, both the dynasty and the crown prince will 
meet an untimely end. What can you do about that? I didn't want to be a witness 
to all that, so I decided to leave. You wouldn't let me, so I had to flee:' 

"Lama, do not speak in such a manner!" replied the emperor. "What you say 
couldn't possibly come true. Anyone who speaks as you do is to be punished! But 
since you have been my guru, I will excuse you. And if you really intend to leave, I 
will let you. In return, try your best to ensure that my life does not end:' 

So, with a change of heart, the emperor showered Tishi Repa with gifts and 
provided him an escort back to Kham. When the party arrived at the border, Tishi 
Repa's mount lay down and refused to stand up again. He told his escorts, "This 
is a sign that from now on I will return to being a wandering beggar." And he pro-
ceeded on foot. 

Along the road, he met Sakya Pandita, the head of one of the main branches 
of Buddhism in Tibet, who was on his way to China. Sakya Pandita wanted to 
honor him by arranging an extravagant welcoming party. However, Tishi Repa 
replied, "There is no need for all that! Just treat me like the humble beggar that 
I am:' 

He continued on his pilgrimage and, taking a very long route home, visited 
Lhasa. A few days after finally arriving back in Kham, he passed away. 

As he had been a guru of the emperor, Tishi Repa's passing was the cause of 
much attention and many ceremonies, and the news soon reached China. The 
new emperor sent emissaries to make offerings as well as to search for a suit-



Gampopa and the Early Barom Masters 

able successor. They returned with a master named Repa Karpo, who was Tishi 
Repa's chief disciple. According to all written accounts, the greatness of this mas-
ter defied all imagination; he was even more accomplished than lishi Repa. Many 
people saw him emitting a resplendent light. He was given immense wealth by 
this new emperor and used it to build many temples. In particular, he built a huge 
temple in Nangchen with innumerable statues, the main being a replica of the 
Jowo Buddha statue in Lhasa. Eventually, he received the same spiritual rank as 
TIShi Repa from the emperor. 

It is among Repa Karpo's disciples that we find my ancestor, Lumey Dorje of the 
Tsangsar clan. Earlier, during an empowerment ceremony with a huge gathering, 
Repa Karpo spotted Lumey Dorje in the crowd and called out, ·Hey, you! Do you 
want to follow mer 

Lumey Dorje approached and replied, ·certainly. How kind of you to make it 
so easy for me-l don't even have to make the request:' Then and there he became 
a disciple of Repa Karpo. 

Before long, Lumey Dorje attained a high level of realization. He also built a 
monastery called Nangso Chenmo to which Nangchen owes its name. It had us 
pillars, making it extraordinarily large. When it came time for the consecration, 
he pitched a small tent and began practicing the instructions he had received from 
his guru. 

During the ceremonies, some benefactors offered him droma, our traditional 
and auspicious but very rich dish of tiny sweet roots swimming in clarified but-
ter. Lumey Dorje consumed one large pot after another, ten in all, and the word 
got around that the master had done something crazy and would die, or at least 
become seriously ill. But when everybody had gathered, he exuded aU the but-
ter through the pores of his body, leaving him even more radiant than before. 
Someone said, ·That can't be an ordinary human body!• Another remarked, ·Look! 
His body doesn't even cast a shadow! You can see right through it. He should be 
called Bodiless Vajra,· which is what Lumey Dorje means. This master was truly a 
sublime being-like a lion among men. 

When his guru Repa Karpo passed away, the funeral ceremony was a major 
event, a special occasion for his disciples to make lavish offerings to honor their 
guru's physical form. Soon after, the great Chogyal Pakpa, a master of the Sakya 
lineage, traveled through the region on his way to China and visited the monas-
tery at Nangso Chenmo.'9 The followers of Repa Karpo told him, •we have been 
abandoned by our master, like a body without a head. You are a sublime being, the 

17 



18 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

emperor's guru and the ruler of Tibet, and we would like to offer the monastery 
and the Nangchen kingdom to you.• 

Chogyal Pakpa replied, •This would be inappropriate because the head wouldn't 
fit the body. I am Sakya while you are Kagyu.It would be like putting a sheep's head 
on the body of a goat. I would rather choose the best of Repa Karpo's disciples. 
I have been entrusted with thirteen emblems of power to be given to thirteen 
people below me; the first of these I will offer to Repa Karpo's main disciple, giving 
him the rank of lachen, grand master. So, choose the one among you who is the 
foremost disciple, and I will invest him with this title so that he can take charge of 
your kingdom.• 

One of the disciples replied, •My Dharma brothers are all equal; there is no dif-
ference. It would be hard for us to choose who is best:' 

•Isn't there one who is just slightly better than the others?· 
·well, there is Lumey Dorje, whose bodily form resembles a golden offering 

lamp, but he has gone to Central Tibet. The rest of us are all equals:' 
•I am also going to Central Tibet. Send someone to find him and tell him to 

meet me there:' 
The messengers found Lumey Dorje near Lhasa, residing at the seat of a close 

disciple of Marpa.111 They escorted him to Chogyal Pakpa, who enthroned him, 
giving him a golden seal and an insignia of precious brocade that symbolized the 
rank of lachen, one of the thirteen imperial priests. Upon receiving these honors, 
Lumey Dorje said, •I have had no other aim in my heart than to be a renunci-
ate meditator, least of all a Dharma king, but I will not oppose your command. 
However, you must appoint me an effective Dharma protector:' 

Chogyal Pakpa then entrusted him with the Four-Faced Guardian, a Dharma 
protector from the Sakya lineage, together with the accompanying empowerment 
and instructions. ChOgyal Pakpa then said, ·You can rest assured that this guard-
ian will follow you everywhere like a shadow follows a body:' 

This was not to be his only protector. Later Lumey Dorje had a vision of the 
female guardian Dusolma. She asked him, ·What do you need?• 

•I don't need anything!• Lumey Dorje replied. 
•Nevertheless,• she said, ·I will protect your Dharma lineage for thirteen gen-: 

erations as if I were present in flesh and blood:' 
Lumey Dorje had also received many empowerments and instructions from 

a great lama in the Kadam tradition and a disciple of the famed Indian master 
Atisha.21 When Atisha came up from Nepal to Tibet for the first time, a Dharma 
protector named Monkey-Faced Ganapati had followed him. At some point, 
Atisha entrusted this guardian to the lama, who later passed him on to Lumey 



Gampopa and the Early Barom Masters 

Dorje, saying, •This protector is half-wisdom and half-mundane; often his activity 
is mischievous.• .. So when Lumey Dorje returned to Kham as a Dharma king, he 
had an invisible following of not just one but three Dharma protectors. 

It is interesting to note that Lumey Dorje-as well as his descendants, my own 
ancestors-had no real wish for secular power and fame but preferred the simple 
life of the renunciate. Perhaps because of this, eventually my paternal ancestors 
lost their position as the kings of Tsangsar to the ruler of Nangchen. 

Lumey Dorje caused the Dharma to flourish throughout Nangchen. It was pri-
marily through his spiritual influence that the kingdom became known as a land 
of meditators. Lumey Dorje remained on the golden Dharma throne for eighteen 
years and then he passed away-or, as we say in Buddhist terms, he •displayed the 
manner of transcending the world of suffering.• For seven days, wonderful designs 
in rainbow colors appeared in the sky for all to see. On his bones, thirteen self-ap-
peared images in the shape of the auspicious white conch were found. Even today 
people still retell the story of his cremation and all the wonderful, truly unbeliev-
able signs. 

By this time, Nangchen was a small country unto itself, and it was now neces-
sary to choose Lumey Dorje's successor. The choice fell on Lumey Dorje's nephew, 
Jangchub Shonnu, who was a lama. He was a disciple of Lumey Dorje's and was 
living as a renunciate meditator in the area. Messengers found him and said, ·You 
must leave your hermitage to be king. You can continue your spiritual activities 
from the golden throne of the Dharma~ · 

•1 don't wish to do anything but meditate in retreat; Jangchub Shonnu replied. 
·What use is your meditation if you ignore the well-being of all those who live 

in the kingdom?" the messengers argued, and so Jangchub Shonnu became the 
successor to the throne. 

On ascending the Dharma throne, Jangchub Shonnu received a high religious 
position from the Chinese emperor, along with many gifts from the imperial court. 
He decided to use his newfound wealth to build a magnificent castle-like palace in 
Nangchen. When he moved there, he transferred the three Dharma guardians as 
well, except for the monkey-faced protector, who vehemently refused to go to the 
palace, preferring to stay behind in the monastery at Nangso Chenmo. 

Every morning Jangchub Shonnu would make a circumambulation of both 
castles and their temples. One morning, while he was walking around Nangso 
Chenmo, a dog attacked and bit him. People started talking. In the new castle, 
they said, •How can they let vicious dogs run around loose? Don't they feed the 

19 



20 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

dogs over there? The manager there is so conceited he thinks he can use our lama 
as food for his mongrels!• 

The servants in the other camp retorted, ·He may be a great lama, but what is 
he doing running around alone every morning?• And the argument escalated from 
there. Words were flung back and forth. That was all it took to create a big rift. But 
we shouldn't be surprised that jealous rivalry abounds in the world of humans. 

In the end, the high Sakya lama who had succeeded ChOgyal Pakpa on the 
throne in Central Tibet was asked to mediate by the manager of the new castle. 
This manager must have been quite politically astute, because when he came back 
he brought a royal decree granting equal status to the two castles, which meant 
that the kingdom would have to be divided Jangchub Shonnu didn't mind and said 
it was fine with him.', 

From then on, there were two castles: one called Nangso Chenmo and the other 
Tsangsar. In time, each was to have its own king. In those days, the throne holders 
of the Dharma were simultaneously the ruler of a major region and oversaw both 
secular and spiritual affairs. Over the centuries, the surrounding areas were con-
solidated into the two kingdoms, which eventually comprised ten thousand fam-
ily estates scatt~r~d over a sparsely populated area. In the following generations, 
many of these masters held high ranks bestowed by Chinese emperors: tishi once, 
pakshi twice, and goshir thirteen times. 

As the Mongols came into power in China, they also gave the Nangchen 
kings official titles and positions. The title conferred upon the Nangchen kings 
was the position of chinghu, which is one rank below goshir but still higher than 
a wang. The whole western continent was divided under the power of four chin-
ghu and eight wang. In our terms, we can equate the chinghu with an affiliated 
but independent ruler, while the position of wang is closer to that of a district 
governor. But the kings in the Tsangsar family-my ancestors-never received 
any such position and remained lamas."' In later centuries, the custom of the 
imperial court was to station its own representative in the various districts of 
Tibet. Just like the high-ranking Chinese official in Lhasa called an am ban, there 
was a similar Chinese delegate in Nangchen and the neighboring kingdom of 
Derge. 

Chinese from Ziling in the north had forced Tsangsar to relinquish most of its 
political power to Nangchen twelve or thirteen generations before mine, during 
the time of the master-poet Karma Chagmey. Then, about three generations ago, 
an important minister from the Nangchen court succeeded in forcing Tsangsar 
under the rule of the Nangchen king and imposed obligatory taxes. So, in the end, 
we lost our independence completely. 



Gampopa and tlze Early Barom Masters 

When I grew up in the Tsangsar mansion, our family line was no longer in-
volved in politics, although we had a continuing spiritual lineage. There had been 
one ngakpa lama after another in my paternal line. The Tsangsar family line con-
tinued as lineage holders of the Barom Kagyu, while all the country's political af-
fairs were handled by the Nangchen palace. 

This state of affairs-Nangchen as rulers and Tsangsar as lamas-went on har-
moniously over the centuries, except for the reign of one king. 

Sometimes worldly power goes to a person's head, and, one fine morning, the 
king of Nangchen looked toward the east and saw that the sun's warm rays were 
prevented from touching his palace by a mountaintop nearby. 

He exclaimed, "I am the king! I want sunlight in the morning, so lop off the 
top of that mountain!" A huge labor force was mobilized and they began chipping 
away at the rock. 

This was no small mountain, but they managed to take a fair chunk off the peak. 
Even today, if you climb that mountain, you can see the results of their labors. 

But the work was overwhelming. Eventually, one of the workers said, "This is no 
good. We're dealing with this in the wrong way': 

"What do you mean?" a coworker inquired. 
"It's easier to chop off the ruler's head than to cut off the head of a mountain; 

the first replied. 
"What are you saying?" 
"Even if we continue for ten thousand years, we will still not finish this work. 

We have been given a horrible, endless task. Let's mobilize everyone and put an 
end to this senseless king!" 

So that's exactly what they did: They cut off the king's head. 

Nangchen was divided into eighteen districts, each with a major monastery. •s 
In the early days, all eighteen were Barom Kagyu, but the lineage waned in in-
fluence as the Karmapa's influence grew over the centuries and many of these 
monasteries began to follow his branch of the Kagyu. By the time I left Tibet, 
only a few small monasteries remained Barom Kagyu; one was my guru's mon-
astery at Lachab. 16 

A bit more about my paternal line of ancestors, with its famous (and perhaps 
a bit pretentious) name, Divine Bloodline of Tsangsar. Ours was a family lineage 
of married Vajrayana masters who for many generations were politically indepen-

dent of the Nangchen king. Over the generations, their estate and mansion were 
no longer vast, but they were not small either. 

As I noted, my ancestors focused on spiritual works, not politics. At one point, 
there were eighteen Tsangsar brothers who together made eighteen sets of the 
Kangyur, the translated words of the Buddha, each written in pure gold. One set 
was offered to the head lama of the Sakya lineage, one to the Karmapa and another 
to Karma Gon, the Karmapa's main seat in Kham. When I was at Lachab, we still 
had one set and there was also one at a small temple under Tsangsar patronage. 
The pages were handmade of thick black paper and the script was a beautiful cal-
ligraphy in pure gold. 

The wives and sisters of those eighteen brothers, a group of twenty-five, de-
cided to create the merit of making twenty-five sets of the many Prajnaparamita 
sutras on transcendent knowledge, each written in pure gold on deep blue paper 
made from powdered azurite. During my time, one of these was still kept at the 
Tsangsar temple. Over the centuries, many people have seen the female protector 
Dusolma circumambulating and paying respect to these scriptures. There was also 
a profusion of artists connected with my family. Once when the Karmapa passed 
through between Tibet and China, he was given one thousand tangka paintings 
as an offering. 

These Tsangsar ancestors all the way down to my great-great-grandfather were 
realized masters. There is almost no one, including my father, who didn't show 
some miracle or sign of great realization. 27 I heard thai one of them was the leader 
of the army from Nangchen and was attacked by a gang of soldiers from Derge, 
but their muskets couldn't kill him. 21 

A more recent and very important link in this Tsangsar family line was Orgyen 
Chopel, my paternal grandfather. Being a married Vajrayana master, he dressed 
as an ordinary layperson. He married Konchok Paldron-my grandmother and 
the only daughter of my illustrious ancestor, the great treasure revealer Chokgyur 
Lingpa-with whom he had four sons, all lamas, and two daughters." These are all 
major figures in my family story. Remember, I was born on the journey when my 
grandmother went in search of Tersey Tulku. 

When my grandmother was given in marriage to Orgyen Chopel, his fami-
ly's basic Dharma lineage was Barom Kagyu-but in name only. By that point, 
they were all following the Nyingma practices found in Chokgyur Lingpa's New 
Treasures, the forty volumes of teachings he revealed for these times. So, it seems 
the Barom seat had turned predominantly Nyingma. 



Gampopa and the Early Barom Masters 

That didn't mean they had completely abandoned the Barom teachings. The 
once-flourishing practice of the Six Doctrines from the Indian master Naropa 
had weakened long ago and was now maintained in only a few places. But by 
unifying Naropa's Six Doctrines with the liberating instructions of Mahamudra 
meditation, many early Barom Kagyu practitioners attained accomplishment-
thirteen could run as fast as horses, another thirteen could run like the wind 
and there were many, many others. Their disciples spread far and wide, all over 
Nangchen. 

The training in Mahamudra, on the other hand, had for the most part taken 
on the flavor of Dzogchen, the teachings of the Great Perfection. All that was 
left of pure Bacorn practice was a very particular ritual involving a way to invoke 
the guardian of the Buddha's teachings. This ritual was continued with very high 
regard-so much so that some monks would accumulate more recitations of this 
mantra than of their yidam deities. In the Tsangsar mansion where I spent my 
early years, there was a special shrine room for the lineage protectors, with huge 
masks covering all the walls. Every day, special petitions and offerings had to be 
performed in front of each. One of them, I remember, was said to give almost 
instant results; over the centuries, there have been many accounts of their protec-
tive powers. 

These days, I am sorry to say, Barom is close to fading out, as very few lamas are 
left to uphold it. I, too, was supposed to do my part, but obviously I haven't done 
much. Of the Barom I have not practiced the Barom style of the Six Doctrines, 
but only the chanting for the Dharma protectors. Instead I have been steeped 
in Chokgyur Lingpa's terma treasures since I was a child. I haven't even had the 
chance to perform the practice connected to Chakrasamvara, the main deity of 
the Barom Kagyu.,., So I am definitely to blame-shame on me!-for letting my 
forefather's Dharma lineage slip away as I occupied myself with Chokgyur Lingpa's 
termas. Actually, my father and one uncle did most of the Barom Kagyu practice 
in our family; they employed the practices for the Dharma protectors. But another 
uncle, Tersey, didn't chant even one syllable from the Barom Kagyu lineage; he fol-
lowed the New Treasures one-hundred percent. 

According to Khampa tradition, since the great terton's sons had no children, 
his daughter's offspring were then highly respected as descendants and represen-
tatives of Chokgyur Lingpa. We speak of two kinds of grandchildren: ·bone line· 
and olood line~ To be a grandchild from bone means being born in the family of 
a son, while a grandchild from blood would be in the family of a daughter. 

The continuation of Chokgyur Lingpa's terma teachings was primarily due to 
my grandmother's having borne four sons, each of whom performed an immense 

23 



24 SPIRITUAL RooTs 

service in propagating this lineage. My father was the second of the four sons; his 
name was Chimey Dorje. My mother's name was Karsa Yuri. 

So that's a short history of both the spiritual and worldly aspects of the Tsangsar 
lineage and, particularly important, how it connects with Chokgyur Lingpa when 
his daughter, my grandmother, was given in marriage to Orgyen Chopel of the 
Tsangsar family. At this point, you may wonder just who this Chokgyur Lingpa 
was and what his New Treasures are-and what exactly are terma teachings? Also, 
what's so important about propagating a Dharma lineage? All this will be my main 
topic in most of the following stories. And it is due to the kindness of my grand-
mother that I even know many of these tales.

The Treasures 
of the Lotus-Born 

At the end of the eighth century, Padmasambhava, the Lotus-Born, arrived in 
Tibet. As the primary master ofVajrayana, he accompanies every one of the thou-
sand buddhas of this eon.'' He had twenty-five main disciples; in later incarnations 
those disciples were reborn as tertons, who revealed teachings Padmasambhava 
had hidden to benefit people of coming times. 

My root guru, Samten Gyatso, had incredible faith in Padmasambhava and 
would tell me how he marveled at the words of the Lotus-Born. Although Samten 
Gyatso was extremely erudite and had studied vast volumes of literature, he con-
tinued to find many fresh levels of meaning in Padmasambhava's teachings. 

•There is no one greater than Padmasambhava: he would often say. ·or course, 
Buddha Shakyamuni is the root, but the Lotus-Born made the Vajrayana teachings 
spread and flourish throughout India-and especially in Tibet. If you look closely, 
you can see just how amazing his terma teachings are! And if you compare his 
terma revelations with any other treatise, you can see their unique quality. The 
reason is that they were from Padmasambhava himself. 

•The beauty of their prose is astounding! It is very difficult for anyone to write 
with such beauty and depth as you find in terma practices. Unlike treatises by peo-
ple who are merely learned, in a terma each word can be understood on increas-
ingly deeper levels. That special quality of Padmasambhava's vajra speech means 
that whenever you read his teachings, you inevitably feel faith and devotion, trust 
and complete confidence! 

·we see that similarly worded teachings appear in the revelations of several 
tertons. The reason is they are all the unmistaken speech of Padmasambhava de-
ciphered from the symbolic script of dakinis:31 he said, referring to female tantric 
deities. ·one need not harbor any doubts. For instance, the Seven-Line Supplication 
starting with 'On the northwest border of the land ofUddiyana' appears in numer-
ous different termas; the different revealers tapped the same source. 



26 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

·sefore he left Tibet, Padmasambhava concealed an abundance of termas con-
taining teachings, precious stones and sacred articles for practitioners in later cen-
turies to follow:" Out of great kindness, the Lotus-Born concealed termas for the 
benefit of future beings-within solid rock, in lakes, even in the sky. Thinking of 
this immense kindness evoked my awe. 

Yet, there are people who can't appreciate this kindness. These days some skep-
tics object saying, ·Tertons probably don't possess the unbroken lineage of em-
powerment and reading transmission from Padmasambhava for their teachings. 
They just dig up a few articles they themselves hid!• 

But in fact, the tertons who later appeared to reveal these treasures had, in 
their past life as his disciples, been blessed by the Lotus-Born master, receiving 
empowerment and reading transmission for those termas. Every terton has al-
ready received the complete lineage-and in an authentic way far superior to the 
superficial manner empowerments so frequently are given these days, which bear 
only the semblance of blessings. 

All the great tertons were masters who, in body, speech and mind, were personally 
blessed, and empowered by the Lotus-Born. To claim they didn't have transmission 
is childish. Such statements demonstrate the speaker's ignorance of the seven tradi-
tional ways of transmission." The terma teachings are amazingly profound and are 
concealed within the treasure chest of the four modes and six limits, ten levels of in-
creasingly profound meaning at which each of the tantric scriptures can be explained 
This is how Samten Gyatso introduced me to Padmasambhava's teachings. 

·u you are interested in exploring them, the layers of meaning in a terma are 
vast. From childhood, a great terton is unlike other children; my guru continued. 
·He has pure visions of deities, and realization overflows from within. Tertons are 
not like us ordinary people who must follow the gradual path of study and prac-
tice. Ordinary people don't have instantaneous realization!·14 

As another of my teachers, Dzongsar Khyentse, told me, ·Termas are like crops 
that ripen in the autumn. Every year, there's a new crop, and each season it is 
freshly harvested and enjoyed, since that is the crop for use at that time. Terma 
teachings were concealed to be revealed at particular periods later in history, and 
they appear in forms most appropriate to the particular time periods in which 
they are revealed: 

When the time came for the different terma teachings to be revealed, great 
tertons would appear in this world. They were able to dive into lakes, fly up to 
impossible locations in caves and take objects out of solid rock. 

My great-grandfather, Chokgyur Lingpa, was one of those masters who re-
vealed the Lotus-Born master's hidden treasures.

My Great-Grandfather, 
the Treasure Revealer 

Chokgyur Lingpa was born near the royal palace in Nangchen and grew up as a 
simple monk in the Tsechu monastery. Once during the annual tantric dances, 
he fell out of rhythm and danced on independently of the others. This upset the 
dance master who then wanted to give him a beating. 

Present in the assembly was Adeu Rinpoche, who was the guru of the king of 
Nangchen. He also happened to be the son of the previous king and therefore a 
very powerful personage in the kingdom; during those days, there was no higher 
lama in Nangchen. Adeu Rinpoche, who had clairvoyant abilities, saw that the 
young terton was participating in a dance of celestial beings taking place in the 
young monk's vision of Padmasambhava's pure realm-Chokgyur Lingpa had 
simply joined that dance instead. 

Adeu Rinpoche came to Chokgyur Lingpa's rescue, saying, ·oon't beat him! He 
has his own style. Leave him to himself.' 

Soon after, Chokgyur Lingpa asked permission to leave the monastery and 
Adeu Rinpoche consented, saying, •Yes, you can go. Travel freely wherever you 
like and benefit beings!• 

Before leaving, Chokgyur Lingpa gave a statue as an offering to the king of 
Nangchen and requested a mount and provisions. 
But the king was a hardheaded character and not 
happy that he was leaving. 

•That crazy monk has given me a statue of 
Padmasambhava that is neither clay nor stone; the 
king said, not realizing it was one of the extremely 
precious terma objects Chokgyur Lingpa had already 
discovered. •Give him an old horse and a saddle 
blanket~ As a result of the king's lack of appreciation, 
Chokgyur Lingpa never settled in Nangchen.

SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

My great-grandfather had not gone through any formal 
studies, yet Old Kongtrullater called him a true pandita, 
a great scholar.ss This change took place while Chokgyur 
Lingpa remained in a strict traditional retreat, lasting 
three years and three fortnights, at his residence above 
Karma Gon in Kham. During this retreat, he, to use his 
own words, "slightly unraveled the intent of the tantras, 
statements, and instructions; referring to the profound 

three inner sections oftantra-Maha, Anu, and Ati Yoga.36 

Chokgyur Lingpa was not just an authentic terton; his revelations are pivotal to 
our lineage. He was the reincarnation of Prince Murub, the second son of the great 
king Trisong Deutsen, who established Buddhism in Tibet. Another of his former 
lives was Sangye Lingpa.37 Chokgyur Lingpa was the "owner" of seven distinct 
transmissions and is often counted as the last of one hundred tertons of major 
importance. 

He is regarded as the "universal monarch of all tertons; in part because no other 
terton has revealed a teaching that includes the Space Section of Dzogchen. There 
are several Mind Section revelations and all major tertons reveal the Instruction 
Section; but only Chokgyur Lingpa transmitted the Space Section. This is why his 
Three Sections of the Great Perfection is considered the most extraordinary terma 
he ever revealed.'' 

Most of the stories I know about how Chokgyur Lingpa revealed termas I heard 
from my grandmother. Being Chokgyur Lingpa's daughter, she witnessed these 
events as a child. My grandmother was never known to lie or overstate anything; 
she was an extremely truthful person who didn't brag or slander. 

She told me how Chokgyur Lingpa once revealed a terma before a crowd.39 

"Often my father would take a terma out in the presence of more than a thousand 



My Great-Grandfather, the Treasure Revea/er 29 

people. It had to be this way, because Tibetans, especially those in the eastern 
province of Kham, were known to be extremely skeptical. They didn't blindly be-
lieve everyone who claimed to be a terton. But Chokgyur Lingpa was beyond dis-
pute, because he repeatedly revealed termas with numerous witnesses present. 

·The purpose of revealing a terma publicly; she continued, •is to ensure com-
plete trust, free from doubt or skepticism. There is no trickery involved; the terma 
is revealed before the eyes of everyone present. If it were just a magic trick, there 
would be no actual, material terma to show afterward, no representation of en-
lightened body or speech.• 

·otherwise, it was no simple feat to convince people that Chokgyur Lingpa was 

in fact an emissary of Padmasambhava. Khampas were even more hardheaded 
than Central Tibetans; they were much more suspicious. Among Khampas, the 
people from Derge were the most skeptical; there was no way in the world they 
would simply believe any impostor professing to be a terton! They would only 
trust someone they had personally witnessed revealing a terma in public. 

·we call such a revelation tromter, meaning 'public terma: a terma revealed 
amid and witnessed by many people. When a terma treasure was about to be 
revealed as a tromter, it would first be announced: 'A terma will be revealed in 
public!' As word spread, a lot of people would gather to watch. 

•A terton would also miraculously receive a 'location-list: which is like a key 
showing exactly where the terma is hidden. Such a text is necessary to be able to 
find the terma and take it out; and having received the location list-a mystical 
guidebook-the terton can see in his mind's eye the layout of the landscape and 
the location of the mountains, valleys, rocks, caves and so on. This list also con-
tains a description of the 'terma sign; a certain mark placed by Padmasambhava 
or Yeshe Tsogyal, for instance the syllable HUNG. The terma site could be a certain 
rock or cave, a place described as looking like a gaping lion, a tortoise or another 
animal of a particular shape indicating the character of the location. The terma 
sign might be found at the throat, between the eyes, at the heart or at another such 
place on that particular animal. 

•The location list will also indicate the proper time to reveal the terma and 
the particulars of the spirit guarding it. Sometimes three different spirits would 
be involved: zhidag, neydag, and terdag. The zhidag, the lord of the land, is, for 
example, like Maheshvara, who guards the entire Kathmandu valley, while the 
neydag, the lord of the locality, is, for instance, like Tarabhir, who guards the sa-
cred place of the female buddha Tara near Nagi Gompa. The terdag,•• the terma 
owner, is the particular spirit who was entrusted with the terma's safekeeping at 
the time it was concealed. 



30 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

"How is it possible for anyone to steal a terma? Perhaps when Guru Rinpoche 
was concealing the terma he was seen by birds and other animals, who then knew 
where it was hidden. In one of their subsequent lives, they could become a terma 
thief. So the command would be, 'Don't allow a terma thief to take this! Don't let it 
fall into the hands of samaya violators! Entrust it to no one but the representative 
of me, Padmasambhava!' 

"In this way, the guardian would already have been instructed by Padmasambhava 
to hand over the terma to the destined terton. The treasure revealer however must 
then give a tribute in return, a kind of bribe. In addition, he must place something 
as a substitute, either a teaching or something precious, such as a sacred sub-
stance; he cannot just carry off the terma like a thief making off with some loot. 

"As soon as the news spread that something amazing was about to take place, of 
course a lot of people would turn up-and why not! Sometimes five or six hundred 
people would be present, once even a thousand. But other times when the terma 
was revealed as a tromter there would only be a small group present consisting of 
seven, twenty-one or more people. 

"On one such occasion, Chokgyur Lingpa presented a ritual drink to the guard-
ian of the terma, accompanied by a request to release custody of the terma. He 
then drew a design on the surface of a rock, whkh opened up like the anus of a 
cow and the stone just poured out to reveal a cavity containing the terma. As the 
interior became visible, we saw that it was filled with scintillating rainbow light. 
We also noticed an unusually lovely fragrance that seemed to permeate the en-
tire valley. A vast quantity of scarlet sindhura powder came spilling forth as well. 
Chokgyur Lingpa handed some of this powder out and people collected it for 
safekeeping. 

My grandmother continued, "Everyone was slowly chanting the supplication to 
the Lotus-Born known as Spontaneous Fulfillment ofWlShes: 

When revealing termas for destined people to benefit beings, 1 
With the courageous confidence of pure samaya, 1 
Free of hesitation and doubt, I supplicate you; 1 
Grant your blessings to spontaneously fulfill all wishes! 1 

"Someone had already arranged a table nearby covered with a brocade cloth to 
place the precious articles on. The terma articles were often too hot to touch when 
taken out and my father was the only one who could hold them. Some were so hot 
in fact that they scorched the brocade"42 My grandmother described these to me 
as "objects from which the heat of blessings had still not vanished:" Sometimes this 



My Great-Grandfather, tlte Treasure Revealer 31 

is used as a metaphor, but, in actuality, sometimes people did get burned. Once 
I actually saw some of these scorched pieces of red and yellow brocade in a box 
containing some of Chokgyur Lingpa's sacred belongings. 

After the great terton took out the terma, he blessed everyone. At this time 
he also gave an explanation of the terma's historical background, how and why 
Padmasambhava concealed it, with what particular aspiration it was buried, why 
it was revealed now, the benefits of receiving its blessings and so forth. 

She said, •1 saw the crowd weep out of faith and devotion, the air humming 
with crying. Even if you were a stubborn intellectual, all skepticism would melt 
away. Everyone was struck with wonder. 

•After the revelation, he placed a substitute for the terma inside the rock cavity. 
For example, if there were two statues of Padmasambhava, then Chokgyur Lingpa 
replaced one of them. If the terma was a scroll of dakini letters, written in their 
symbolic script, he would place some other precious article in its place. Then he 
finished by walling up the cavity, sometimes with stones, sometimes even melting 
the rock as if coating it with plaster. If Chokgyur Lingpa simply set some rocks in 
the crack, people who later went back to check discovered that the surface had 
naturally 'healed; all by itself." 

My grandmother was not the only person I knew who actually saw Chokgyur 
Ungpa reveal termas. Once, while I was living at our Tsangsar family home, Perna 
Trinley, who had been the great terton's servant, came to stay. He spent the last 
year of his life with us and was about ninety years old when he passed away. Being 
young and curious, I questioned him about his days with the terton and he told me 
all that he remembered. Here is one of his stories: 

·once, while Chokgyur Lingpa was in a small village at the foot of beautiful 
Mount Karma, he was given the opportunity to reveal a 'cattle terma: Believe it 
or not, he announced that he would bring forth real animals! Hearing this, many 
people gathered around him, proceeding with much commotion to a steep cliff 
that rose up the side of Mount Karma. 

•1n those days there were no matches, and Chokgyur Lingpa's cook, Lhagsam, 
had forgotten to bring along a fire kit of flint and steel. Without a fire kit, he 
couldn't make tea, so he sent his helper down to the village to fetch one. But all 
the villagers were out collecting wild, sweet droma potatoes on the hillsides, so the 
cook's helper had to return empty-handed. 

•While the helper was heading back up the mountain, Chokgyur Lingpa had 
been at work in his tent in front of the cliff. Already people could hear cattle 



32 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

lowing and bellowing from deep within the mountain. It sounded as if the ani-
mals were just about to break through the surface of the rock. Everyone heard 
it-some were even frightened, thinking they were about to get trampled. 

•Right then, the cook's helper yelled out, 'Hey, Lhagsam! I've got no fire kit! There 
was no one at the village!' The great terton heard this from within his tent and 
asked, 'What did he say? They vanished? They are gone?' You see, in the Khampa 
dialect, the word for fire kit, which is mesa, and the cook's name, Lhagsam, can 
also sound like the word for 'vanished; 'gone: While Chokgyur Lingpa asked what 
was said, the sounds of the animals gradually vanished. 

·chokgyur Lingpa then exclaimed, 'The auspicious circumstance has passed! 
The cook's helper bungled it! We shouldn't stay here! Let's pack up and leave!' 
Everybody then left in a flurry. They didn't even have a cup of tea, since they 
couldn't start a fire~ 

My grandmother once told me why we in the lineage of Chokgyur Lingpa don't 
need to fear local spirits like Gyalpo Pehar or Samten Kangsar.u 

On one of Chokgyur Lingpa's trips to Lhasa by the northern route, the party 
was caught in a terrible snowstorm on the vast plains. Even after the main storm 
subsided, a tremendous amount of snow continued to fall for a week or so, pre-
venting them from continuing their journey. The travelers started to fear for their 
lives. They grew so desperate that they began to burn any flammable objects they 
could find-even the wooden frames of their saddles. 

At an emergency meeting someone said, ·we still have a long journey ahead 
of us. We haven't even crossed the pass. What's going to happen to us? With this 
snow I fear the worst. Let's ask the terton for help; it's our only choice~ 

When the crisis was brought before the terton, he responded, •The elemental 
forces of the valleys and the mountain spirits have ganged up to test us. They are 
taunting me, insinuating that I am not the lineage holder of Padmasambhava. But 
don't worry, just wait and see what happens. Divide the practitioners up into two 
groups: the ngakpas should stay with me in my tent and the monks should remain 
in Karmey Khenpo's charge. Prepare yourselves by training in the tummo yoga, for 
tonight we will perform the practice of the soaked cotton garments. It is the only 
way to deal with this~ 

The two groups began to practice the yoga that very afternoon and they pro-
duced so much heat that people outside could see douds of vapor rising from both 
tents. At midnight the heavy snow douds began to disperse and by morning the 
sky was clear, without even a wisp of cloud. Not only that, but all the snow around 



lvfy Great-Grandfather, the Treasure Revealer 

Chokgyur Lingpa's tent had melted; you could see the stones on the bare ground. 
The sun rose in a blue sky to reveal splendid weather and the snow continued to 
melt across the entire plain. The streams became swollen to their banks with all 
the melted snow. 

Chokgyur Lingpa suggested they stay for a few days and during that time the 
snow continued to melt. At one point he exclaimed, ·rm still not done with those 
guys! Samten Kangsar, Nyenchen Tanglha and some of the other spirits still seem 
to have their minds set on putting us through an ordeal. Sam ten Kangsar needs to 
be taught a lesson today. Please prepare a big white torma and bring it to me:' 

That afternoon, after the petitions to the guardians, Chokgyur Lingpa heat-
ed up the torma until the butter decorations on top melted down to its shoul-
der. Meanwhile, looking at Mount Samten Kangsar-from which the spirit has 
his name-in the distance, everyone saw that the snow on its peak had begun to 
melt and was gushing in streams down the mountainside. The next morning, large 
patches of black rock were visible.44 

After Chokgyur Lingpa had subdued Samten Kangsar, the weather was bril-
liantly clear for three days straight; there was not a single cloud in the sky. The 
melting snow caused quite a flood in low-lying areas. 

Wherever Chokgyur Lingpa traveled, he was accompanied by many learned and 
accomplished masters. His splendorous dignity and sphere of influence were com-
parable to those of the great Karma pa-so that even spiritual masters served as his 
attendants. One such was Karpo Sabchu, a yogi adept in Naropa's Six Doctrines 
and especially accomplished in the feat of swift walking. It was said that he could 
cover the distance from Kham to Lhasa-ordinarily a two-month journey-in a 
day, bringing back fresh vegetables. 
:· . Once, when she was still a girl, my grandmother was sitting outside the great 
terton's tent with her mother, Lady Degah.45 In the distance, they saw a man ap-
proaching on horseback. As he rode closer, they recognized him to be a Northerner, 
a balding old nomad with braided hair and glaring eyes, wearing an unusually 
short goatskin coat. His mount was an albino with bloodshot eyes. Such horses are 
rare and known to have bad eyesight in the snow . 
. · Usually a visitor would, out of respect, dismount quite a distance from the cen-
tral tent; but this man surprised my grandmother by riding straight up to Chokgyur 
Lingpa's tent, dismounting and going inside without looking right or left. 
· : Lady Degah said, ·oid you see that brazen Northerner heading straight for the 
terton's tent? He was just about to ride right into it:" 

33 



34 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

·He was staring straight ahead without the slightest glance right or left; com-
mented my grandmother. ·ooesn't he know he's supposed to see the dronyer first?• 
The dronyer is an attendant in charge of receiving guests. 

As Chokgyur Lingpa was always in the company of his close disciples, the two 
women had no cause to worry about his safety and thought nothing more of the 
strange visitor. They went about their business. 

Inside the tent, the great terton was seated upon a makeshift throne of stone 
and wood collected from around the camp.46 The visitor plopped himself down 
right in front of the terton and just sat there without saying a word. 

The servant Karpo Sabchu felt no suspicion and served him tea, thinking to 
himself, ·These Northerners have no sense of etiquette, as we well know. Look at 
this brash old geezer; he's so pushy he didn't even wait to be let in~ 

In addition to being a yogi, Karpo Sabchu was also quite playful with people. He 
sat down next to the old man and rubbed his knees affectionately while remarking 
on how cold they were. The stranger was carrying a plain crooked stick in his belt 
that Karpo Sabchu tried to grab in fun, playing the fool with the old nomad. 

At some point, the old man and Chokgyur Lingpa seemed to be making ges-
tures and faces at each other. Suddenly the great terton assumed an awesome 
air, raising his right hand high, quite majestically poised. The stranger let out a 
sharp howl and suddenly disappeared-vanishing completely into thin air. Karpo 
Sabchu looked outside, to reassure himself that he hadn't been hallucinating, but 
he discovered that the horse too had vanished without a trace. 

As the day wore on, Karpo Sabchu began to feel sick to his stomach. Because 
Chokgyur Lingpa's close disciples knew to bring only the gravest of matters to his 
attention, Karpo Sabchu kept his mouth shut and quietly went to the kitchen to 
prepare for the meal. But before long he began to feel a gnawing pain, something 
like worms writhing about, eating away at his stomach. Although by now he felt 
extremely sick, he still didn't want anyone to tell Chokgyur Lingpa. As time went 
on, though, Karpo Sabchu became so ill he was certain he was going to die. Finally, 
he told someone to inform the great terton. 

My grandmother had heard Karpo Sabchu's cries of anguish. Soon she saw 
Chokgyur Lingpa and the dronyer heading for Sabchu's tent and tagged along 
to see what was happening. She poked her head in the door and saw Karpo 
Sabchu curled up on his bed, writhing in pain. She saw Chokgyur Lingpa frown, 
as he said, ·He's sure to die. Who else would be foolish enough to touch-and 
even play around with-a demon? He even grabbed hold of the demon's stick 
and so he has lost his life force47• There's no doubt about it: he's not long for this 
world~ 



My Great-Grandfather, tlze Treasure Revealer 35 

The others then beseeched the great master to do something, if anything could 
be done to save the life of the poor yogi. After some pleading, Chokgyur Lingpa 
finally growled, •prepare a burnt offering outside; I'll take care of the rest:" 

When Chokgyur Lingpa came out of the tent, he threw some tsampa in the fire 
and blew on it, and immediately Karpo Sabchu's moans subsided. When Karpo 
Sabchu was well enough to get up, he slunk back to the terton's tent. •1 suddenly 
felt iliis worsening pain. It got so bad I couldn't stand on my feet. Then, just as sud-
denly, it went away. What on earth happened?• 

•The old man who came to see me today; Chokgyur Lingpa explained, ·is actu-
ally an infamous spirit with quite fierce powers. He had assumed a human form. 
Your days were numbered the moment you touched his walking stick. The spirit 
asked me, J\ren't you the emissary of Padmasambhava? In all the snowy ranges 
of Tibet, there is nothing I need, no advice I seek. I am very powerful. Even so, I 
have one small problem: There are two other spirits who just won't leave me alone. 
They bother me at every opportunity. If it weren't for those two, I would be one 
of the greatest spirits in all Tibet. So how can I subdue them? If you will just give 
me some helpful instructions, I promise not to harm or bother anyone in your 
lineage: 

•1 replied, J\re you willing to constantly visualize the Lotus-Born guru above 
your head in the form of the glorious Subjugator of All Appearance and Existence, 
one inch in sizer I told him that if he answered yes, I would give him instructions. 

·sut the spirit replied, 'No, I definitely will not!' 
·so, I said, 'Well, then, if that is the case, this is what the glorious Subjugator of 

All Appearance and Existence looks like in his full splendor!' 
·sut all you saw was me raising my hand It was then that the old man gave out 

a yelp and disappeared without a trace. But before scaring him off, I extracted his 
promise never to bother my descendants, lineage holders or their followers:" 

One day, Chokgyur Lingpa was invited to the large monastery at Samye. The 
main courtyard was elaborately decorated with brocade and banners, and the mas-
ter was requested to take his seat upon a lofty Dharma throne. People filled every 
inch of the courtyard, creating a multicolored array dominated by the maroon and 
yellow of monk's robes, just like at the famous prayer festivals in Lhasa. 

This was no small event; it lasted for almost seven days and had great signifi-
cance, both secular and religious. At some point, an elaborately dressed monk, 
wearing layers of brocade garments, approached the throne and engaged the mas-
ter in conversation. As it happened, Chokgyur Lingpa's personal tea server and 



36 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

cook was the reincarnation of the great terton Mingyur Dorje~which was not 
unusual, since his attendants were often tulkus.41 

Mingyur Dorje saw the elaborately costumed monk talking with his master 
and thought, •Who is that proud old guy taking up our guru's time? He may be a 
dignitary-they are all so proud-but he has been here long enough and I need to 
serve tea~ So under the pretext of serving tea to the master, he put his arm on the 
old monk to push him aside. The stranger, however, didn't yield; quite the contrary, 
he held his ground. A small scuffle broke out between the two. 

Finally, after a while, the man turned and walked off. As he did so, Chokgyur 
Lingpa gave a command for him to be escorted through the tightly packed crowd 
and the man departed with great dignity into the main temple. 

Not long after this incident, Mingyur Dorje felt sharp pains in his belly. They 
grew so acute he soon couldn't even stand up. Chokgyur Lingpa, of course, could 
not be approached about anything but important matters. So Mingyur Dorje just 
told the dronyer, ·rm not feeling weU-1 need to be excused. Please ask the master 
if he could give me his blessing.• 

Hearing this, Chokgyur Lingpa exclaimed, •What does he expect after trying to 
wrestle with Gyalpo Pehar? Doesn't he know that one shouldn't let one's shadow 
fall upon a powerful spirit? Not only did he cover Pehar with his shadow, but he 
tried to manhandle him as well-aU for the sake of a cup of tea! It's a given that 
anyone who touches a spirit will lose his life~ 

So, though Mingyur Dorje was in unbearable pain, instead of being consoled, 
he was scolded-like Karpo Sabchu, who had fooled around with that spirit mas-
querading as an old Northerner-and told that he was soon going to drop dead! 

The dronyer acted as a go-between for Mingyur Dorje, asking Chokgyur Lingpa 
if anything could be done. Chokgyur Lingpa, softening, told him to get a certain 
text and chant four particular lines about •undoing the web• and •untying the 
knots• and to accompany this with an offering at the temple to Gyalpo Pehar. They 
carried out his instructions-and sure enough Mingyur Dorje recovered. 

My grandmother told me this story when I was a child. She added that Chokgyur 
Lingpa was not in the habit of bragging about seeing supernatural beings. On the 
contrary, he mentioned it only on rare occasions, when specifically asked. Indeed, 
he rarely volunteered a word about any of his exceptional powers, such as clairvoy-
ance. There were a few rare exceptions, however, as the following story shows. 

One fine day, the terton and his following were riding up the Tolung valley on 
their way to Tsurphu. As my grandmother rode along behind him, she heard him 



My Great-Grandfather, tlte Treasure Revealer 37 

tell stories of the political infighting and skirmishes that occurred between the 
factions of the two potential successors to the fifth Dalai Lama, Sangye Gyamtso 
and Lhabsang. 

The two men were excellent friends, and each insisted the other should rule 
the country-they didn't want a struggle. So finally they agreed to settle the shift 
of power with a throw of the dice. Sangye Gyamtso, who was skilled in astrology, 
picked a favorable day for the event to take place, but the calculations showed that 
everything had to be settled and completed on that same day. He told Lhabsang, 
•If I win, you have to pack up and leave with your entire following and all your 
possessions. If you win, I promise to immediately do the same:' 

The dice were thrown and fell in Sangye Gyamtso's favor. Lhabsang went to 
prepare to leave, but soon he returned to say, •My wife is pregnant, and it appears 
she is soon to give birth:' 

So Lhabsang stayed on, and during that time political intrigues began to fester. 
As you know, the wish for political power can exert a tight grip on people's heart, 
one not easily relinquished. What happened next would be a long and involved 
tale, but the long and the short of it is that, at some point, the fledgling regent 
Sangye Gyamtso found himself alone on horseback trying to escape a band of 
Lhabsang's soldiers. 

•They caught up with him right there where the road bends; said Chokgyur 
Lingpa, pointing at the roadside to everyone's amazement, ·rm the only one now 
who knows what happened, since that was one of my previous lives. In those days, 
important captives were not brought back home but immediately beheaded. See 
that row of mani stones? That's where my body fell. My head rolled all the way 
over there:' 

Wide-eyed and amazed at her father's clairvoyance of past lives, my grand-
mother rode past the site and continued on to Tsurphu. 

Karmey Khenpo told my grandmother the following story: Chokgyur Lingpa 
decided to go to the marketplace in Lhasa. On one street, all the butchers line up 
their meat on tables, and all you can see is blood and guts. They hack the flesh off 
the carcasses and sell it right on the spot. 

•otrby herself was a tall woman with a strange look in her large eyes. I thought 
she had a bluish hue to her face, and in her hand she wielded a large knife. With 
great skill, she carved off large chunks of meat that she sold to the customers who 
were lined up.

Yeshe Tsogyal-

of the Lotus-Bom 

•What occurred next really took me by surprise. Before we knew what was 
happening, the terton had not only walked up to her but bowed his head, and her 
large hand covered the crown of his head. This was something we had never seen 
before, and we wondered what he could be up to now. Not only was he asking a 
woman to bless him, but a butcher at that! 

•My oh my! How inauspicious!' I thought. We were flabbergasted, and it wasn't 
until we had headed on that I had the chance to ask the terton who the woman was. 

•What do you mean, who is sher the terton asked. 'It seems no one among us 
is as fortunate as I, for I was the only one to be blessed by the female buddha Vajra 
Varahi in human form. You could so easily have received her blessing too, but not 
one of you even thought of asking: 

Karmey Khenpo was a very strict monk who rigorously upheld his vows, in-
cluding the vow not to touch women. As he later told my grandmother. •There's 
no way in the world I would have asked a woman for a blessing!• 

My great-grandmother Dechen Chadron was known as Lady Degah. Chokgyur 
Lingpa's personal consort, she was the daughter of one of the twenty-one dis-
trict governors of Derge. Lady Degah was also regarded as an emanation of Yeshe 
Tsogyal, the closest disciple of Padmasambhava. 

I don't like saying this, for it may sound like I'm bragging about my family line, 
but there are scriptures in which the Lotus-Born predicted that Chokgyur Lingpa's 
three children would be emanations of the three chiefbodhisattvas: Avalokiteshvara, 
Manjushri, and Vajrapani. The Manjushri emanation was supposed to be his son 
Wangchok Dorje; the Avalokiteshvara emanation his other son by a different con-
sort, Tsewang Norbu; and the Vajrapani emanation my grandmother. 

Lady Degah could be quite wrathful On several occasions, she set her will 

~----------------~ 

against the great terton-not too seriously, but 
she was sometimes stubborn enough to start a 
squabble. She was strong-headed and liked to 
have a drink now and then, which didn't bother 
Chokgyur Lingpa. But he didn't appreciate her 
drinking from a garuda claw that he had discov-
ered when revealing a terma. One day, he said, •1 
didn't go to the trouble of recovering this rare ga-
ruda claw for you to use as a shot glass! I won't 
stand for you pouring liquor into it-it's only for 
sacred substances!· 



My Great-Grandfather, the Treasure Revealer 39 

Lady Degah retorted, •Whether it's made from a garuda's claw or a yak's horn, 
it holds a drink really well! And that's what I'm going to use it for!· And she im-
mediately poured herself a drink. 

Chokgyur Lingpa fired back, ·How easy do you think it is to come by the claw of 
a real garuda? Such a bird lives only on the summit of the fabulous Mount Sumeru. 
Padmasambhava concealed it in a terma for the benefit of this time. Its real pur-
pose is·to help cure epidemics caused by naga spirits. But day and night, you with 
your brazen attitude use it for nothing better than having a drink:' 

Someone later said that it was Lady Degah's obstinacy that caused their sec-
ond child, my grandmother, to be born a girl. But I still feel that my grandmoth-
er's life-whether she had been a boy or a girl-fulfilled the Lotus-Born master's 

prophecy that she would be an emanation of Vajrapani. It was thanks to her hav-
ing four sons, who performed immense service for the continuation of Chokgyur 
Lingpa's terma teachings, that they are so widespread today. This stems from her 
being an emanation of a bodhisattva. 

Truly remarkable! 

Karmey Khenpo told Konchok Paldron this story as well: 
·ouring one journey, Chokgyur Lingpa was passing through an area that lies 

on the road between Lhasa and Kham that was well known as a favorite spot for 
bandits and thieves to prey on travelers and pilgrims. At this point, the road forks 
off to the Amdo region, leading into another area full of bandits. 

·The leaders of the gangs from each region held a meeting, and for a good reason. 
'We have received news that a large caravan of seven or eight hundred Khampas 
are coming our way. Some of them are rich and have many pack animals. We must 
combine our forces and strip them of all their valuables; proposed one of them. 

•As a result, we saw a gang of bandits following us, but they never came closer. 
Each day, a dozen or so would appear on a hilltop to keep an eye on us; we felt like 
goats being stalked by a leopard. Chokgyur Lingpa was kept abreast of develop-
ments with regular reports. 

·Among his revealed treasures, Chokgyur Lingpa had a particular practice-
from his past life as the chief disciple of Sangye Yeshe of Nub-that was a certain 
way of calling upon the Dharma protectors. So Chokgyur Lingpa summoned me to 
his tent and said, 'Take up your pen; we need to teach those bandits a lesson once 
and for all! Write down what I say: Chokgyur Lingpa then dictated the full practice 
that he had learned in his previous life from Sangye Yeshe. It contained lines on 
how the great Nubchen master commanded the guardians of the Dharma, includ-



40 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

ing instructions on how to blow their bone trumpets in a particular way. When I 
had finished writing the practice down. Chokgyur Lingpa asked us to perform this 
ritual together with a torma offering. 

·That night, the bandits made their move, but they found the camp encircled by 
a pack of ravenous wolves! The roles of predator and prey were suddenly reversed, 
and they found themselves fleeing the gaping jaws. The story spread far and wide 
that two or three bandits weren't fast enough and were torn apart. 

·sut some bandits were still around and decided to try again the following 
night. That night we performed this ritual again and we had barely completed it, 
in fact the bone trumpets had only sounded a couple times, before the bandits 
began closing in on the camp. One of the bandits yelled, 'You see, there's nothing 
to be afraid ofl' 

•Then, all of a sudden the bandits saw Chokgyur Lingpa's trident catch fire, and 
his tent burst into flames. To their amazement, the flames grew and spread until 
the entire camp was engulfed in a raging sea of fire. 

·Not a single bandit dared walk into the inferno. Instead, they sat down and 
waited. They later claimed that the fire continued blazing the entire night. Most 
of the bandits lay down to sleep and, to their surprise, when they woke up in 
the morning they saw that the camp was totally intact with people milling about, 
packing up. 

•The bandit leader told his second-in-command, 'These I<hampa lamas are 
more than we can handle! Put out the word to let them go back where they came 
from-the sooner the better!' Word proceeded the caravan and so they never en-
countered another bandit the rest of the way to Lhasa. 

•While we were in Lhasa; Karmey Khenpo added, •news of what the bandits 
had experienced began to arrive-how some were eaten by wolves and others 
consumed by flames. With that, the bandits' faith grew, and, one by one, they 
came to receive Chokgyur Lingpa's blessing~ 

Terma predictions had described how Chokgyur Lingpa's remains should be 
enshrined in a golden stupa upon his death and Old Khyentse personally came 
to supervise the enshrinement. The stupa had been gilded in gold that the great 
terton had revealed from his termas. It was a very large stupa; I remember it to be 
unusually high, approximately three stories in fact. Chokgyur Lingpa's body was 
placed inside as the main relic.

Two Sublime Masters 

KHYENTSE 

Let me tell you about two outstanding masters whose role in the New Treasures 
is inextricably interwoven with that of my great-grandfather, Chokgyur Lingpa. 
Their connection goes back a thousand years to the time when Buddhism reached 
Tibet When the magnificent Samye, Tibet's first major monastery, was under con-
struction, great masters were invited from India: Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, 
Buddhaguhya, and others. Their chief Tibetan disciples included the translators 
Vairotsana and Yudra Nyingpo. All these masters, disciples, and translators helped 
the teachings of the Buddha to flourish like the rising sun. 

During the time of Khyentse, Kongtrul, and Chokgyur Lingpa, those twenty-
five foremost disciples of the Lotus-Born who had gathered around him at Samye 
almost a thousand years earlier all returned in simultaneous incarnations. As one 
of my teachers, Dzongsar Khyentse, put it, ·The twenty-five disciples of the Lotus-
Born came back together like a throng of sheep and goats running out of a barn. 
These disciples reappeared as masters with incredible experience and realization, 
learning, and accomplishment. Their personal disciples and their disciples' dis-
ciples were equally amazing~ 

In fact, throughout Kham and the rest of Tibet, tulkus of all twenty-five were 
identified and recognized. Paradoxically, this flowering was a portent that the 
time for Tibet's role as a field of influence to benefit beings was just about to run 
out. 

There had been a prediction from Padmasambhava pertaining to two of these 
masters: ·vou possess the karmic link of father and son~ The father was the great 
Khyentse and the son was Chokgyur Lingpa. The prediction also said, •Their 
minds will mingle into oneness• -meaning they would be identical in their level 
of experience and realization-·like the torrential rivers of summer~ That image 



42 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

referred to their meeting, exchanging pith instructions and awakening their kar-
mic potential. 

The great Kongtrul was enthroned by Khyentse and Chokling as the authentic 
incarnation, or conscious rebirth, of the Tibetan translator Vairotsana. When you 
compare these three masters-Chokgyur, Khyentse, and Kongtrui-Chokgyur 
Lingpa regarded both the great Khyentse and Kongtrul as his teachers. But 
Khyentse received the entire New Treasures transmission from Chokgyur Lingpa, 
so in this regard Chokgyur Lingpa is one of his teachers. The great Kongtrul defi-
nitely accepted Khyentse as his master-there is no question about that-as he did 
Chokgyur Lingpa. So, in fact, all three were one another's teachers and disciples. 
They were connected to each other as "mingled minds.• In this way, the three mas-
ters assisted each other. Their mutual benefit for the Buddha's teachings and all 
beings was like that of the sun of Dharma once again rising in the sky. 

Early in his life, Chokgyur Lingpa made the journey to the kingdom of Derge. 
There he met with Kongtrul, who showed great fondness for the young terton and 
for his terma writings. One of Kongtrul's letters mentions this: "When you see the 
terma teachings of this man who doesn't even know his grammar, it is most amaz-
ing! It's really strange that such wonderful writing can come through a man who 
cannot even spell!" 

In those days, one needed a letter of introduction in order to gain an audience 
with a lama of high standing, so Chokgyur Lingpa requested such a letter, saying, 
"I want to go see Jamyang Khyentse Wan gpo; please give me a petition letter:' The 
great Khyentse was then known by the name Venerable Shabdrung; a shabdrung 
corresponds in level to the vajra master in charge of tantric ceremonies, a reli-
gious rank two steps below the highest hierarch of the Sakya school. 

So Kongtrul replied, "Of course I'll write a letter introducing you to Venerable 
Shabdrung!" With the letter in hand, Chokgyur Lingpa then proceeded to 
Khyentse's residence. 

Prior to this, Khyentse had written down a mind treasure containing the com-
plete teachings of the famous terma Tukdrub Barchey Kunsel. Now, Chokgyur 
Lingpa arrived, also bringing a version of the Tukdrub, which had been revealed to 
him at the sacred place of Khala Rong-go. He had kept it secret for eight years. 

Chokgyur Lingpa explained to Khyentse the story of his revelation, including 
the time and place of its discovery and the nature of the terma teaching. While 
comparing the two versions of the terma, they found them to be totally identi-
cal, without even one word of difference. After a careful examination of the two, 



Two Sublime Masters 

Khyentse burned his own, saying, "Since the words and the meaning are identi-
cal, what is the use of having two! Yours, being an earth terma; a physical object 
the tcrton discovers, "is more profound and will be more effectual than my mind 
tenna; one that unfolds in the terton's mind. 

Thus, the blessings of two lineages, earth terma and mind terma, were fused 
into a single stream. This remarkable coincidence was a major reason for the pro-
found trust they had in each other as authentic tertons. After their first meeting, 
they both had many auspicious dreams and visions. The great Khyentse accepted 
Chokgyur Lingpa as his disciple, conferring several important empowerments 
upon him. 

Chokgyur Lingpa then returned to see Kongtrul at his residence, located at the 
famous Tsari-like Jewel Rock, on the slope above the Palpung monastery in Kham. 
Kongtrul had fallen seriously ill and was unable to see. Chokgyur Lingpa gave him 
the empowerment for the deity Vajrapani from his terma treasure called Vajra 
Club of the Lord of Secrets and told him to do some recitations of the mantra. That 
was their first Dharma connection. 

Chokgyur Lingpa insisted, "You must do this practice-nothing else will help 
you regain your eyesight!" After Kongtrul had completed a retreat reciting the 
mantra of this tantric deity, he fully recovered from his disease. 
: When Kongtrul recounted the story of his recovery, Chokgyur Lingpa respond-
ed, ·or course you recovered. In your past life as the great translator Vairotsana, 
you put a curse on the infamous Lady Margyenma, that troublemaking queen of 
King Trisong Deutsen.49 Now you had to suffer the ripening of that karmic deed. 
In keeping with the severity of your former action, the karmic ripening corre-
sponded to the seriousness of the disease with which your retinas were atllicted. 
This disease was influenced by the naga spirits. Accordingly, Padmasambhava de-
signed this special sadhana of Vajrapani to cure you. That's why I gave you that 
particular empowerment:" 
: • From then on, Kongtrul and Chokgyur Lingpa gained even stronger confidence 
in each other, further fortified by several auspicious dreams and visions. 

Khyentse, Kongtrul and Chokgyur Lingpa went on several journeys together, 
during which they discovered many terma teachings. The most famous of these 
was the Light of WISdom, which later played an important role in my own educa-
tion.50 

Khyentse was born in the kingdom of Derge in Kham. The name Derge means 
•virtue and happiness:" This area was traditionally saturated by the practice of

Buddhism, a virtuous and perfect place for the Dharma ruled by kings in accor-
dance with spiritual principles. Over the centuries, these kings had promoted the 
most favorable conditions for the Buddha's teachings. for example, they saw to the 
carving of woodblocks for printing the entire vast Buddhist canon-consisting of 
the many hundred volumes of the translated words of the Buddha, the Kangyur, 
and the translated treatises, the Tengyur-a task that had until then proved insur-
mountable even for the government in Central Tibet. 

Here's how that enormous task began. One day, while King Tenpa Tsering of 
Derge was walking to his bathroom, the thought suddenly arose in his mind, ·Maybe 
I could get woodblocks carved for the entire body of the Buddha's teachings.• 

Later, when the king was visiting with his guru Situ Chokyi Jungney, he felt he 
should bring up his new idea. So he said, •Today I had a thought:" 

•What was that?" the master asked. 
•z formed the wish to carve blocks for both the Kangyur and Tengyur. What do 

you think? Will it be successful?" 
Situ Chokyi Jungney replied, ·oon't ever give up this thought!• 
·very well; the king agreed, •zf I arrange for the carving, can you do the proof-

reading?• 
•I will take care of the proofing; the great Situ promised. 
No more conversation than that took place. Eventually, the king did have the 

entire Buddhist canon carved and printed. Situ, who was renowned as a great 
scholar, proofread the woodblocks thirteen times-a gigantic task in itself. This is 
why even today we regard the Derge edition of the canon as being of the highest 
standard. 

It was in such a spiritual environment that the great Khyentse took birth. 

Old Khyentse was the combined reincarnation of 
Vunalamitra, King Trisong Deutsen, Longchenpa 
and the omniscient master Jigmey Lingpa-all in 
one body. Like Chokgyur Lingpa, he was renowned 
as the lord of seven transmissions. Yet Khyentse 
didn't start out as the head of a large momistery, 
but as an ordinary monk at a Sakya monastery in 
Derge.51

longchenpa-

the great 
Dzogchen master L~S~e~~~:__j 

In the early part of his life, Khyentse went to 
Central Tibet, where he received a vast number 
of teachings from numerous masters. Slowly his 



Two Sublime Masters 45 

talents led him to become a teacher, then vajra master, then shabdrung and fi-
nally abbot. During his second visit to Central Tibet, he transmitted most of these 
teachings back to others. And so people said, ·Before he was a disciple; now he is 
a master!• 

At one point, Khyentse had a deep spiritual experience involving a vision of the 
great m~ster Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, after which he put in writing the precious 
teaching known as the Heart Essence of Chetsun. At the main Sakya monastery in 
Central Tibet, he did a retreat on Manjushri and had the experience of dissolving 
into the heart of his yidam so the •great treasure mine of courageous eloquence· 
overflowed from within his state of realization. Thus, he became like a king of all 
learned and accomplished masters. 

Old Khyentse later built a hermitage, which he gave the splendid name 
Gathering Palace of Sugatas. He lived there in the latter part of his life. 

Old Khyentse had developed unimpeded clairvoyance. Tashi Ozer, the great 
scholar of Palpung monastery, was one of his main disciples, and he told one of my 
teachers many stories about the great Khyentse. Here is one of them: 

·one day; Tashi Ozer recounted, •Khyentse exclaimed to me, 'Oh, my, Khenpo, 
what trouble you have! From morning until night, you have to do all these tasks: 
He started mentioning all the different things I had to do. He knew everything, 
every little detail-including things no one else but me cou1d have known about. 
'You are really burdened by all these demands; you have no free time at all: It was 
true,1 was busy from morning till evening. 

•Another day, Khyentse Wangpo, as he was known at the time, suddenly cried 
out, 'Oh, no, how terrible!' I asked him what was wrong. 'Far away a bald monk 
just fell over the side of the cliff. While he was falling, 1 heard him shout my name. 
Then, while 1 was thinking about this, somehow he became stuck in the branches 
of a tree. Now the other monks are trying to pu11 him up with ropes. Yes ... now 
they got him up: 

•The next morning, a bald-headed monk came to visit Khyentse. 'Last night 
1 had a strange accident; he said. He went on to explain that as he was walking 
with a stick and a load, he fell over the side of the cliff, at which point he shouted 
out, 'Khyentse Wangpo! Khyentse Wangpo!' He didn't fall all the way down but 
became caught in some branches and was then pulled up with a rope. 

·one night,1 wanted to see for myself how Old Khyentse slept. So 1 hung around 
outside his door and took an occasional peek throughout the night. Khyentse did 
not seem to go to sleep at all. But late at night he loosened his belt, relaxed in 



46 SPIRITUAL RooTs 

his seat and exhaled. Then he just sat there with wide-open eyes, still breathing 
deeply. He might have been asleep or not, but he didn't move for an hour, still with 
open eyes. Then he cleared his throat loudly and his breathing went back to nor-
mal. The sound was enough to signal his attendant to prepare morning tea. That 
was how Old I<hyentse passed his nights:' 

Near where the great I<hyentse lived was a Sakya monastery, and it happened 
that one of their lamas passed away. The monks of the monastery trusted that 
I<hyentse truly could see past, present and future as dearly as something placed 
in the palm of his hand-without a flicker of error or confusion. He was consulted 
about the lama's rebirth. 

The monks kept insisting, "We must find him! By all means, we must find his tulku!" 
•you might as well forget about it: replied Khyentse. •1 promise you it won't 

help you to know:' 
·we will never give up our search for him!• retorted the monastery's repre· 

sentative, who wasn't one to take no for an answer. ·our teacher was so precious; 
please give us some unmistakable details regarding his whereabouts:' 

·Au right!• said I<hyentse. ·Go to such-and-such place near Derge, where there 
is a rich family with plenty of cattle. Stand near their house and call out your lama's 
name at the top of your voice. It will be clear to you where your 'tulku' is:' 

The party went off in the prescribed direction and reached the rich man's prop· 
erty. There they began calling their lama's name as loud as they could. As they were 
yelling, the calf of a huge cross-bred yak and cow let go of its mother's teat, bel-
lowed ·Moooooooo!• and ran toward them. It walked around them and wouldn't 
leave. The monks were at a loss as to what to do. On their return, they stopped to 
see the great Khyentse once again. 

•What did I tell you? Didn't I say it would be useless? Nonetheless, you did find 
your 'tulku:" 

Old Khyentse had the habit of asking ·every visitor one particular question. I 
know this from old people in Nangchen, because everyone there without extep· 
tion who could afford the time to make the pilgrimage over to Derge had been 
to visit him and pay their respects. My mother's uncle, a lama who was quite old 
when I was a child, told me this story about one such visit he had. 

·well, well, where are you from?• Khyentse would first say. Then, •why are you 
here?· 



Two Sublime Masters 

•1 came to meet you, Rinpoche,· replied this old lama. 
•There is nothing special in meeting me,· said Khyentse. •Have you seen the 

Jowo in Lhasa?· 
~o. I haven't; replied the old lama. 
•What a pity! What a waste of a human life. Well, then, have you received the 

reading transmission for the Kangyur?· 
•No, I haven't, Rinpoche!· 
·oh. no! What a terrible shame! In this day and age, the Buddha is represented 

by the Jowo statue and the Kangyur. That's what he has left behind. If one dies 
without meeting those two, I would consider it just as if one had returned from a 
jewel island empty-handed. If a big sinner, even someone who has killed eighteen 
people, receives the reading transmission for the Buddha's Kangyur, this old man 
here swears that such a person will not go to the lower realms:" 

Khyentse said that to almost every person who came to visit him. 

Once, in the later part of his life, Khyentse was served poison mixed in curd 
by a malicious old man from eastern 1ihet. He accepted the bowl and drank it on 
the spot. As the man was leaving, Khyentse called out to him, ·Hey, you! Are you 
satisfied now that I've swallowed your evil drink?• 

The old man panicked and began to cry with great remorse. 
•please vomit it out immediately!• the old man wailed. •I don't know what vi-

cious spirit took hold of me, but all of a sudden I had this thought to poison your 
food and didn't seem able to resist. The moment you drank the bowl, it was as 
though I woke up from a dream. Please, purge yourself of this poison!• 
~o; Khyentse said. •I have repaid a karmic debt to you, so I won't vomit-there 

is not enough to kill me. I drank it to help you:" 
Earlier in his life, Khyentse had been very handsome and stout. People said he 

looked like Longchenpa. But soon after being poisoned, he fell ill and never totally 
recovered; his skin turned slightly dark. The toxin had also injured his throat, and 
every so often he would have to clear his throat with a loud hacking noise, even 
during teachings. •It is from being poisoned, but it didn't kill me; he would explain 

to the curious. 

Grandmother, who had met the two masters as a child, once told me, ·The great 
Kongtrul was neither tall nor fat, but he did have a prominent nose, very straight 
and square. Old Khyentse, on the other hand, was very large, with big eyes:"

My father later added, •After Chokgyur Lingpa and his son Wangchok Dorje 
had both passed away, I too went with Lady Degah, my mother and some siblings 
to visit Old Khyentse. When we approached his quarters, we discovered that the 
great master had come outside holding the traditional incense and white scarf 
to receive Lady Degah-an unusual sign of deep respect. Led by Old Khyentse 
bearing incense, we were escorted inside his rather tiny room. Samten Gyatso and 
your uncle Tersey were both there as well. I remember Khyentse as having a big-
ger-than-life, majestic presence in that small room:' 

My father continued, •Khyentse was conducting an empowerment for my 
grandmother. Next to him was a little portable hearth, with a big kettle perk-
ing away on top. There was a Khampa-style bellows made of hide, and every 
once in a while during the empowerment Khyentse would reach over and fan 
the fire. He had a large bowl, and during the empowerment he put a couple of 
spoonfuls of tsampa-parched barley flour-and dried cheese into his bowl. 
Then he poured some hot tea on top and, using his large bone spoon, had a 
meal right there and then. He didn't drink butter tea, just black tea:' As you may 
know, it is the tradition in Tibet that while a lama drinks tea during a ceremony, 
he always takes off his hat-but Old Khyentse was a yogi and left his hat on 
while he ate. 

·He was such an imposing figure in that small room,· my father added. ·The fire 
was making it quite warm, and I sat near the hearth. He just went about his busi-
ness and looked very comfortable eating and drinking at his leisure:' 

Khyentse was a great siddha, incredibly realized. Yet probably because he held 
the position of ·king of Dharma~ ruling over a vast domain of spiritual activity, he 
did not manifest a rainbow body upon his departure.l2 

Instead, here is how he passed away. 
All his life, Old Khyentse never sat idle; at the very least he would usually have 

a rosary in his left hand, chanting various mantras. One day, he told his servant, 
·one's final words should be like those of Terdag Lingpa, the great master of 
Mindrolling:' -

•And what were they?• his attendant asked. 

Sights, sounds, knowing-deva, mantra, dharmakaya-
Piay of kayas, wisdoms, boundlessly they merge. 
In this deep and secret practice of great yoga, 
Be they of one taste, nondual sphere of mind! 



1lvo Sublime Masters 

While chanting the last line, Old Khyentse rolled up his rosary, put it in its 
proper place, straightened his back and stopped breathing. 

Kongtrul often said of his friend Old Khyentse, "Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo 
is the.only one who can truly distinguish between what is Dharma and what is 
not~ Kongtrul would turn to him for advice in all matters of importance, calling 
him "the ultimate pandita~ In this sense, the most important of the three amazing 
masters-Khyentse, Kongtrul, and Chokgyur Lingpa-was Khyentse. 

So when Khyentse passed away, Kongtrul exclaimed, "The omniscient Dorje 
Ziji has left us!" using another name for Khyentse. "Now we are left behind in 
pitch-black darkness, not knowing right from wrong!" Khyentse had made it clear 
that he didn't want anyone to preserve his body after he died. He had explained, 
"Don't keep my body around. 1 want it cremated, because in this degenerate age, 
one should no longer keep an entire body as kudung (sacred remains). Of course, 
in earlier times it was the custom to do so with some masters. But from now on, 1 
think all lamas should be cremated~ 

With Chokgyur Lingpa, who had died before Old Khyentse, he had made an ex-
ception. The reason was that Padmasambhava's 
terma predictions had described how Chokgyur 
Lingpa's remains should be embalmed and en-
shrined in a golden stupa, which was done ex-
actly as indicated.

However, Khyentse and Kongtrul were both 
cremated, as were Karmey Khenpo, Tashi Ozer, 
the great Mipham and all the other great lamas 
of the day in Kham. 1 believe this change was 
an early indication that everything was soon to 
be destroyed by the Chinese communists. But 
Khyentse didn't mention that. He just said to 
never keep a kudung.

KoNGTRUL 

Kongtrul is considered a reincarnation of Vairotsana, the eminent translator of the 
Buddha's teachings when the Lotus-Born master came to Tibet.n Vairotsana, in 
turn, was regarded as an emanation of Buddha Vairochana.

Mipham-
the famous 

Kongtrul had the ability to reveal a vast number of terma treasures; he once 
found a prophecy by Padmasambhava predicting that he, Kongtrul, was to com-
pose five great treasuries of teachings. In his view, the older tcrmas had great 
value, and he wished to gather them all into a collection to be called the Treasury 
of Precious Termas, covering the three inner tantras: Maha, Anu, and Ati Yoga.S4 

So Kongtrul sent a message to Chokgyur Lingpa: "You often meet the Lotus-
Born in person. Could you please ask him if I may compile the Treasury of Precious 
Termas?" 

Chokgyur Lingpa soon sent back this reply: "I asked Padmasambhava. He said, 
'Excellent!' Since that is the case, you must definitely undertake this task.· 

While Kongtrul was in the process of collecting these treasure texts, the lineage 
for many of the termas of former tertons had disappeared, some of them centuries 
before. Khyentse revived them as 'rediscovered treasures' and in this way supplied 
the important missing parts for the Treasury of Precious Term as, while Chokgyur 
Lingpa was the one who asked the Lotus-Born master for permission. Thus, the 
incredibly important collection now renowned as the Treasury of Precious Termas 
was a combined effort of all three masters. 55 

Old Kongtrul's reincarnation, Karsey Kongtrul, the famous son of the fifteenth 
Karmapa who was also one of my teachers, was in charge of the library at Tsari-
like Jewel Rock. He still had this exchange of letters in which Kongtrul requested 
Chokgyur Lingpa to ask Padmasambhava about the Treasury. Once, while Karsey 
Kongtrul transmitted this very same Treasury of Precious Termas, he told me the 
above story in the presence of the sixteenth Karmapa. 

In terms of scholarship, Kongtrul was nearly 
unsurpassed, as a story about him and the learned 
Mipham shows. After Mipham had composed his 
Summary of Logic, a sophisticated and complex 
philosophical volume, he brought it to Kongtrul to 
get his opinion. 

scholar -'!v.::·&• 

"It looks like a work of outstanding precision and 
clarity; remarked Kongtrul. "But honestly, I'm not 
the one to judge. I don't know much about Buddhist 
logic, since I never studied the subject. You are an 
expert in the art of validating knowledge; I'm sure 
it's very good.• 



Two Sublime Masters 51 

Mipham wouldn't accept Kongtrul's modesty. So he made the request, •please, 
Rinpoche, give me the reading transmission for it." 

•How could I possibly do that? .. replied Kongtrul. "You're the author. If I had 
written it, I could give the transmission. But you should read it to me instead." 

So, obediently, Mipham read the text aloud. At the end, Kongtrul suddenly 
exclaimed, •Ha, ha! Let me try to explain it:' 

•p)ease do, Rinpoche; Mipham replied. •you may not have studied many words 
of logic, but you certainly know the meaning:' 

•No, no; Kongtrul insisted. •I am not well versed in either the words or the 
meaning. But today is a fine day and I'm in a good mood. Let me try explaining it:' 

When he had finished his explanation, Mipham was astounded. •Rinpoche, 
how could you give such a brilliant clarification without having studied logic?" 
Mipham asked. 

Kongtrul explained, ·wen, it's not exactly the case that I didn't study logic ever, 
since in a former life as Sakya Pandita I studied it extensively. In fact, it all came 
flooding back to me while you were reading. I don't usually have that ability, so I 
wanted to explain it to you while the glimpse lasted:' 

After this encounter, Mipham saw Kongtrul in a completely new light, and his 
admiration and trust in him grew. As Mipham explained, "Our intellectual under-
standing is completely different. That man's learning extends back through many 
lifetimes, completely unlike ordinary scholars who study a few books here and 
there in this life:' 

After the scholar Tashi Ozer had studied with the renowned Paltrul, he re-
marked, •How can there be another lama of that kind on the surface of the 
earth? He is tremendously learned and accomplished!" Later, having studied with 
Khyentse, he said, "No one can possibly be more extraordinary!" Lastly, when he 
had studied with Kongtrul, he said, •fantastic; this man is incomparable!" 

One day, he had the chance to ask Khyentse, •Rinpoche, I'm a student of all 
three of you lamas, and I don't perceive anything other than great qualities in each 
of you. But tell me: If you were to compete, who would be the most learned?" 

•pa]truJ for sure is the most learned; Khyentse replied. 
·or the three of you, who benefits beings the must?" 
Khyentse replied, •As the translator Vairotsana in human form, there is nobody 

who benefits beings like Kongtrul:' 
Again the scholar asked, ·sut among you three who has the highest realization?" 



52 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

Khyentse raised his shoulders and head high and, without any hypocrisy or the 
least hint of smugness, declared, ·Hey! The one with the highest realization? That's 
me! I'm the best~ 

When Old Khyentse passed away, the fifteenth Karmapa saw in a vision that 
instead of just a single reincarnation, twenty-five emanations would appear, each 
embodying one of the twenty-five aspects of fruition: five each for enlightened 
body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity. Among these, five principal incarna· 
tions were recognized and enthroned. That's why we see so many reincarnations 
these days with the name Khyentse. 

It is said that the activity of these amazing Khyentse incarnations is unceasing, 
like the moon rising when the sun sets: when one passes away, another appears in 
his place. When he died, several tulkus appeared to take over his Dharma activi· 
ties. Seen from our side, while one of them dissolves back into the buddhafield, 
another emanation appears, sometimes even more brilliant than the previous one. 
After the great Khyentse died, Dzongsar Khyentse appeared, who was equally 
amazing. Then when Dzongsar Khyentse set, Dilgo Khyentse rose. 

Khakyab Dorje had a similar vision that after Kongtrul passed away there 
would be twenty-five reincarnations as well. The number of such tulkus-·magi· 
cal forms· that appear to benefit beings-is inconceivable. 

I don't know much more than this about Kongtrul and Khyentse. You can find 
the details of their lives in their respective biographies. 56 I haven't made up any of 
these stories myself; I've only repeated the words I have heard from my precious 
teachers.

Lord of Activity, 
the Fifteenth J(armapa 

After Khyentse and Kongtrul, no one performed a greater service for the prop-
agation of Chokgyur Lingpa's New Treasures than Khakyab Dorje, the fifteenth 
Karmapa. 

Before passing on, the Karmapas traditionally write a letter describing where 
their next incarnation will be born. And so it was that Khakyab Dorje was found 
as a young child in the Tsang province of Central Tibet by a search party of la-
mas who used as their guide a letter written by the previous Karmapa. Chokgyur 
Lingpa further confirmed his identity in an imlepemlcmt prediction that pointed 
to the same child. 

From an early age, Khakyab Dorje was remarkable. While still quite young, he 
was asked to consecrate a monastery neiu his family home. ·ru do it on the first 
day of the twelfth month; he replied. 

By that time, he was residing in Tsurphu, quite a long distance from the mon-
astery he had been asked to consecrate. But instead of traveling there, on the 
morning of the chosen day he just asked for a covered basin. His attendants 
thought he was playing when he told them, •Today I am consecrating a monas-
tery far away!• 

·· They played along with him when he insisted that two attendants carry the 
basin around Tsurphu. The young Karmapa walked along throwing grains into the 
basin. Later, some people who lived near the distant monastery made the journey 
to Tsurphu and said that grain had fallen from the sky on that very day, just like a 
light rain. 

As he grew up, Khakyab Dorje came to possess profound scholarship, but he 
also performed many miracles. He was a terton who had access to both earth and 
mind treasures. 



54 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

Sometimes terma objects just suddenly appeared in the Karmapa's hands, very 
hot and sometimes moving of their own accord. This happened once while he 
was on a visit to the Amnye resion. He received a terma from a local spirit and it 
was still quite hot while he held it-so hot that when he put it on the table, other 
people couldn't touch it without being burned. All these terma objects were still 
kept at Tsurphu when I was there. 

Instead of having to go out somewhere, like a cave, to find the terma, the 
Karmapa had many terma objects brought to him by the spirits who were keep-
ers of the termas. The Dharma protectors would place terma caskets on the table 
right in front of him at Tsurphu. 

I saw one such terma object that was kept in his sacred treasury box: an image 
of the Lotus-Born master, highly unusual in that half the body was bronze and the 
other half pure crystal. I have never seen another like it. I also saw many sacred 
kilaya daggers and other Padmasambhava statues and was told when and from 
whom he had obtained them. One kilaya dagger was of meteoric iron with a crys-
tal top, also extraordinary. There were many such exquisite treasures, like nothing 
I have ever seen anywhere else. 

Sometimes in his field of vision the Karmapa would suddenly see terma box-
es appear, floating toward him in space. Occasionally these floating boxes were 
even seen by others. This happened once while the Karmapa was on pilgrimage to 
Yarlung, a few days from Tsurphu. As he was riding, terma boxes began to swirl 
around him in midair. Several of the servants saw them. 

•Today there was a viciouS attack of evil spirits: one of the servants later com-
mented. 

·rm not sure how vicious it was,• the Karmapa replied. 

Because the Karmapa is an emanation of buddha activity, when a terton con-
nects with him, that in itself increases the propagation of the terma teachings. 
A look through the history of tertons reveals again and again that if one of the 
Karmapas shows respect for a terton, then the Karmapa's influence and blessings 
will make everyone accept the terton and his teachings without doubt or dispute. 
This is why major tertons need to link up with the Karmapa; otherwise, the terton 
is at risk of being called crazy or a charlatan. 

But although the Karmapa discovered many termas, he himself never seemed 
to write down the many texts connected to them. The Karmapa once explained, 
•With the abundance of revelations from Khyentse, Kongtrul and Chokling, there 
is no need for me to add any new termas!" 



Lord of Activity, the Fifteenth Karmapa 

At Tsurphu, in the inner chambers, there were forty boxes containing amaz-
ing representations of enlightened body, speech and mind given to him by the 
guardians of various termas. When showing these spiritual treasures to my uncle 
Samten Gyatso, the Karmapa once again emphasized, •There were teachings to 
write down, but I didn't-there is no way 1 need to compete with the three great 
tertons. I find their termas neither incomplete nor in need of correction:' 

Samten Gyatso told me, .. Khakyab Dorje was an inconceivably great master. 
I felt sure that he could perceive the three times as dearly as something placed 
in the palm of his hand:' This remarkable clairvoyance made it possible for the 
Karmapa to identify close to one thousand tulkus during his lifetime. 

Since Samten Gyatso and KhaJ..:yab Dorje were very close, my uncle had no 
qualms about asking even very personal questions. Once he asked the Karmapa 
how he knew where tulkus would be reborn. Although he had unimpeded clair-
voyance, the Karmapa explained that he did not always have complete control 
over it. On the one hand, sometimes he would know when a lama was going to die 
and where he would be reborn without anyone first requesting this information. 
Then, when the disciples responsible for finding the tulku would come lo inquire 
about the lama, he would already have written down the details of the tulku's 
death and rebirth. 

In other cases, he could only see the circumstances of rebirth when a special 
request was made and certain auspicious circumstances were created through any 
of a number of practices. And in a few cases, he couldn't see anything, even when 
people requested his help. He would try, but the crucial facts would be ·shrouded 
in mist:' This, he said, was a sign of some problem between the dead lama and 
his disciples. For instance, if there had been fighting and disharmony among the 
lama's following, the whereabouts of his next incarnation would be vague and 
shrouded in haze. 

•The worst obstacle for clearly recognizing tulkus; he explained, •is disharmo-
ny between the guru and his disciples. In such cases, nothing can be done, and the 
circumstances of the next rebirth remain unforeseeable:' 

The Karmapa was supposed to be a major terton, so there was good reason for 
him to take a consort, which is necessary to ·unlock the treasure chest• of the ter-
mas.57 However, the Karmapas were usually monks, and so taking a consort was 
not readily accepted; in fact it was considered highly inappropriate. His reluctance 

55

The Great Dakini 

ofTsurphu 

to reveal termas or take a consort caused him to become seriously ill. Some say 
this was a punishment meted out by the dakinis to potential tertons who fail to 
fulfill their mission. 

Whatever the case, in the end, many great masters persuaded him to take a 
consort; if he didn't, they pleaded, he would die prematurely. His first consort 
was the eldest daughter of a noble family from Central Tibet. As predictea by 
Padmasambhava, she was to be his consort for revealing termas. Afterward, he 
also married his consort's younger sister. 

Later still, when the Karmapa again fell ill, a prediction by the Lotus-Born 
appeared in a terma revealed by a terton from Surmang.s• It stated that if the 
Karmapa accepted a particular young woman, who was a dakini in human form, 
his life would be extended by three years. 

The Karmapa sent out a search party, who identified her and invited her back 
to Tsurphu. She became known as Khandro Chenmo, which means "the great 
dakini."59 He took her as his consort, and she did indeed seem to extend his life for 
three years. Any time the Karmapa fell ill, she was invited to visit him, and within 
a couple of days he would recover. This went on for three full years. The value of 
extending the life of the Karmapa is immeasurable. 

Khandro Chenmo was very beautiful and she became a remarkable practitio-
ner. She was loving and compassionate, full of devotion, and with an unfathom-
able spiritual depth. I knew her quite well in the last years of her life. We first met 
in Tsurphu when I was twenty-six, then again three years later and then later still 
in Rumtek, where she finally departed for the invisible realms two years after flee-
ing Tibet. She was a very special being, a true dakini. She spent almost all her time 
in retreat practicing sadhana and reciting mantra, and reached a profound level of 
experience and realization. This is not hearsay; I can bear witness to it myself. 

Sam ten Gyatso had immense respect for her and once 
told me, "When I went to visit the Karmapa, she was of-
ten there. It felt like meeting the female buddha Tara in 
person. She is Noble Tara among us in a human body, 
an authentic dakini~ She, in her turn, was very fond of 
my uncle and each year would send a present to him in 
Kham. · 

Khandro Chenmo was treated with immense respect, 
as though she were a great lama. Word would spread 
wherever she went and thousands of people would go 
to meet her. She traveled to Bhutan at the invitation of 
the royal family and when she came to visit Dzongsar 



Lord of Activity, tlte Fifteenth Karmapa 57 

Khyentse in Gangtok, he personally came out to greet her. At special ceremonies 

she was usually placed on a throne as high as Khyentse and Kongtrul. But she 
never made a big deal out of herself. 

The great scholar Tashi Ozer was Kongtrul's attendant for a time, and he told 
me about the Karmapa's last meeting with his teacher KongtruJ. The meeting took 
place at Kongtrul's retreat place above Palpung.6o 

•I have come here to pay my respects upon my departure; the Karmapa said. 
·well, well. If you are leaving, I may come and live for a while in your house; re-

plied Kongtrul. The Karmapa thought Kongtrul might be implying that he would 
come back as the Karmapa's child, though he didn't say anything. 

As I mentioned, according to tradition, a senior monk is dispatched from the 
monastery of a deceased lama to inquire of the Karmapa (or another highly real-
ized master) where the tulku might be found. After Kongtrul's passing, this task 
fell by coincidence to Tashi Ozer, who traveled all the way to Tsurphu to ask the 
Karmapa where Kongtrul's reincarnation was. 

•Please give us some indication of where the tulku has been reborn; he re-
quested. 

Khakyab Dorje kept silent, so Tashi Ozer tried again, "I'm one of his chief dis-
ciples-you must tell me! I am sure you know." 

The Karmapa still said nothing, but this didn't dissuade the great scholar. 
He kept insisting, until finally the Karmapa admitted, "Very well, the great 

Kongtrul has been reborn as my son. I cannot and do not dare send back the mes-
sage that the rebirth of my root guru is my own child!" 

. Tashi Ozer objected, ·oon't you remember? I was present when our great vajra 
holder explicitly said he would 'come to stay at your house: Didn't you hear that 
with your own ears? And isn't it true that you call Kongtrul your root guru? So tell 
me, are you going to go directly against his word?" 

This was typical ofTashi Ozer's persuasive, hard-to-refute manner. I don't know 
how long the argument dragged on. But in the end he succeeded in bringing the 
Karmapa's son back to Palpung in Kham where he was enthroned as the reincar-

nation of the old Kongtrul. 

Samten Gyatso transmitted the New Treasures to the Karmapa or, in my uncle's 
words, he "presented it as a mandala otfering;6' including the complete empow-
erments, readings, and instructions. At this point, there were several arrange-



58 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

ments necessary-for liturgies as well as for empowerments-which, like this one, 
had been codified neither by Chokgyur Lingpa, his son Tsewang Drakpa, nor by 
Khycntse or Kongtrul. 

As these arrangements were needed for extremely important and profound ter-
mas, Sam ten Gyatso requested the Karmapa to compose these texts. The Karmapa 
kindly agreed and dictated them to his close disciple, the outstanding lama Jam pal 
Tsultrim. 

While the Karmapa was giving the empowerments, everyone lodged at Lotus 
Garuda Fortress, the retreat center nestled on the cliff high above Tsurphu. Often 
they all stayed up talking until midnight, when Uncle Tersey and Samten Gyatso 
would go back to their own rooms. 

At that time, the Karmapa had already written a letter predicting his own future 
reincarnation. But as his life had been extended for three years with the help of his 
third consort, he needed to write another. 

One evening, they were engaged in conversation when Samten Gyatso sud-
denly asked, •1n your prediction about your next incarnation, you stated that you 
would take rebirth in the area of Denkhog, in the Dilgo family. You were ill then, 
but you didn't die and have in fact recovered. However, you will die one day, so 
when you do, will you still be born in that same place? If not, where will you take 
birth?• 

Uncle Tersey was sitting next to him and was quite upset by the question. He 
later told me, ·He actually asked that! Such an inauspicious question! I got really 
upset, thinking, 'Why does he have to ask a question like that while the Karmapa 
is still alive? What is he thinking? What got into him? This is so inappropriate: 

•The Karmapa became totally quiet; the silence grew longer and longer. I 
thought he was angry, and why wouldn't he be? At that point, I felt really scared. 
We were just sitting there and the Karmapa had stopped speaking to us. He just 
sat there for the longest time, not saying a word. 

•Finally, the Karmapa broke the silence: 'The previous coincidence of time and 
place has vanished. I will not be born into the Dilgo family:-

Samten Gyatso's response to this was to simply join his palms and say, •Lasoh! I 
see!· Then he remained quiet, too, for a time. But then he asked once again, ·well, 
if that's the case, where will you be reborn?· 

Uncle Tersey had tried to nudge Sam ten Gyatso's thigh to stop him from asking 
such an impertinent question once again, but it was too late. ·How inauspicious to 
ask the Karmapa about his own death!• he thought. 

But the Karmapa seemed unfazed. He answered matter-of-factly, •I will take 
rebirth to the east not far from there. If you know the area of Denkhog, you must 



Lord of Activity, the Fifteenth Karmapa 

also know that to the east of the Oil go estate lies that of the influential Ado family. 
I will be born into that family~ 

Uncle Tersey just held his silence, but he kept the information in mind. 
That was the kind of master the Karmapa was. 

After Samten Gyatso left Tsurphu, the Karmapa summoned his close retinue: 
Jampal Tsultrim, Khenpo Lekshey and his main consort, Khandro Chenmo. He 
held up an envelope and told them, ·one of you three should take care of this pre-
diction letter. There will come a point when it will be indispensable. At that time, 
read it, but before then, just hold on to it~ 

"I can't take care of this. I'm too-young for this responsibility; Khandro replied 
as she was only nineteen at the time. 

Khenpo Lekshey said, •1 don't dare to either~ 
The two of them turned to Jam pal Tsultrim and said, ·You keep it!• 
So Jampal Tsultrim put the letter inside the reliquary box he wore around his 

neck and kept it there. 
A year or so later the great Karmapa finally left his body. There were many 

ceremonies during the first forty-nine days. Jampal Tsultrim was subsequently 
invited to Mindrolling to give the reading transmission of the Collected Works of 
Khakyab Dorje. Afterward, he went straight to Golok, his home region far away to 
the northeast, for four or five months. 

In the meantime, the government in Lhasa had sent a representative to Tsurphu 
asking to be shown the prediction letter, • According to your tradition, the Karmapa 
always leaves an exact description of where he will take his next rebirth. We would 
like to see it!• 

They found the earlier prediction letter but noticed that the Karmapa had add-
ed a sentence at the bottom, ·The coincidence for this has dissolved." A frantic 
search for another letter began. 

Jampal Tsultrim was gone; Khenpo Lekshey, having entered strict retreat, was 
incommunicado; and Khandro Chenmo was devastated. Nobody thought to even 
ask her about the letter. The search team rifled through every single one of Khakyab 
Do*'s books. They even tore open his mattress. But, of course, they came up with 
nothing-Jampal Tsultrim was unsuspectingly wandering about in distant Golok 
with the letter in the box around his neck. 

Fmally, the Tsurphu officials were forced to admit that they had no letter. Soon 
after, the thirteenth Dalai Lama's office issued a formal statement that the Karmapa's 
reincarnation had been born as the son of one of the cabinet ministers in Lhasa.

60 SPIRITUAL RooTs 

This news reached all the way to Golok. Hearing it, Jam pal Tsultrim cut his stay 
short and hurried back to Tsurphu. As soon as he arrived, he exclaimed, •What 
do you mean there is no prediction letter? I have it right here!· And he opened his 
reliquary box and showed it to the general secretary at Tsurphu. 

•you enemy of the Dharma! How could you do something like this?!?• exclaimed 
the general secretary angrily. •you should be immediately tossed into prison!· 

•Throw me into prison if you like, if it will help in any way. The letter, however, 
is right here in my hand. There is no mistake~ 

•This is a disaster! The government of Tibet has already nominated another 
tulku. What are we going to do?· the general secretary asked, perplexed. 

A messenger was immediately sent at top speed to the great Situ of Palpung 
in faraway Kham. And as the Karma Kagyu and Drukpa Kagyu were enjoy-
ing very harmonious relations at the time, another messenger was sent to the 
Drukchen Jamgon to ask his advice. The counsel of other respected lamas was 
also sought. 

One lama stressed the importance of being in harmony with the Tibetan gov-
ernment. But the Drukchen reportedly differed, saying, ·u the Karmapa is not 
the right one, then the chances are nil that future Kagyu tulkus will be accurately 
identified~ 

So he suggested that all the monasteries perform extensive ceremonies peti-
tioning the Dharma protectors for their blessings. At the same time, a delegation 
was sent to Lhasa informing the government of the newfound letter, with the mes-
sage, ·we have found the Karmapa's prediction letter and it is authentic~ 

The officials at the central government replied, ·rirst you say there is no letter 
and now you say there is. The office of the Dalai Lama has already issued a posi-
tion. It cannot be changed.• 

The petitioning and refusal went back and forth for an entire year. Then one 
day, while playing on a rooftop near the Potala, the cabinet minister's son fell and 
broke his pelvis. In those days, such injuries were very serious and the boy soon 
died of complications. Now the Tsurphu office was asked to send out a search 
party for another candidate. 

As the Karmapa had written the prediction letter in beautiful poetry with ex-
tremely precise details, Tsurphu only submitted a single candidate-the one iden-
tified in the letter. The Lhasa government replied, •you cannot submit just one 
candidate. That's the same as you deciding who the tulku is. If you are asking us to 
decide, which is the tradition, you must submit two or three different choices and 
we will decide which one it is~ 

Again Tsurphu was in major turmoil and one meeting followed another. 



Lord of Activity, tlze Fifteenth Karmapa 61 

But the I<hyentse of Palpung, another important lama from Kham, was not 
only very wise but also very clever. He came up with an idea to circumvent the 
proud officials in Lhasa. "Make one candidate's name the son of the father; he 
suggested, "and the 'other' candidate, the name of the son of the mother:' So they 
wrote down two different names for the same boy, sent them to the government 
and awaited their reply. When it finally came, it said, "The correct tulku is the son 
of the mother, not the son of the father:' 

This was how the authentic tulku of the fifteenth Karmapa was established at 
Tsurphu after many trials and tribulations. 

When I think of the fifteenth Karmapa, Khakyab Dorje, I am struck with amaze-
ment! To have such far-reaching powers of clairvoyance!

KARMEY KHENPO 

Among the many remarkable masters who were disciples of Chokgyur Lingpa, 
one of the foremost was the learned scholar Karmey Khenpo. He was regarded 
as a reincarnation of Shantarakshita, the great pandita from Sahor in India 
who was the very first master invited to Tibet for the construction of Samye 
monastery. 

Karmey Khenpo started out as a Kagyu practitioner and the main khenpo-pre-
ceptor-abbot and chief teacher-at Karma Gon, one of the three seats of the 
Karmapa. 

He was no ordinary person, and an ancient terma by Padmasambhava predict-
ed he would become Chokgyur Lingpa's main disciple. He became a very devoted 
follower and extremely realized. Yet he usually served as Chokgyur Lingpa's atten-
dant, even though he was said to be as learned as the renowned fifteenth-century 
master Karma Chagmey. The erudite Dudjom Rinpoche-one of the most out-
standing masters of recent times-was amazed by Karmey Khenpo's writings and 
once told me, •It's so wonderful that someone like Karmey Khenpo could possibly 
exist in this world~ 

. My grandmother told me, ·When I was young and went to see my father, if 
Karmey Khenpo was in with him, I would complain to my mother, 'Now we have 
no chance of seeing Daddy. Karmey Khenpo just slipped in and for sure he'll stay 
in there for at least an hour or two!' 

•He seemed to have endless questions, and he always carried a silver ink pot, 
a bamboo pen and some blank paper, so that when he asked Chokgyur Lingpa 
questions he could write down the answers on the spot.61 He was an extraor-
dinary master; he looked like one of the sixteen arhats in the traditional fresco 
paintings~ 



Spiritual Sons 

Karmey Khenpo adhered strictly to the rules for a monk: during his entire life 
he never let meat or alcohol touch his tongue. It was also said that his hand had 
never even grazed a woman nor had he ever allowed a lie to cross his lips. 

Even though he was so gifted and close to Chokgyur Lingpa, Karmey Khenpo 
never had the good fortune to receive the Three Sections of the Great Perfection 
from the great terton in person. He was a bit upset at not receiving it. •Chokgyur 
I.ingpa had so many termas; Karmey Khenpo would lament, ·but the one I regard 
as the real essence 1 haven't had the good fortune to receive:' 1 was told he ago-
nized over it. But after the terton passed away, Karmey Khenpo had a vision of 
Chokgyur Lingpa's wisdom-body and received the complete empowerments and 
transmissions of the Three Sections then. This restored his self-confidence. 

·Even though 1 was never lucky enough to receive the Three Sections while 
Chokgyur Lingpa was alive, my transmission is unique,· he later told the Chokling 
ofTsikey, a reincarnation of Chokgyur Lingpa.63 

•After Chokgyur Lingpa dissolved into the basic space beyond form,• he ex-
plained, ·rus immaculate wisdom-body appeared before me and transmitted the 
Three Sections to me in full. As 1 am the only one to have received this transmis-
sion mind-to-mind, it is not just unique but of a higher level than yours. Because 
of that, this lineage 1 now hold should not be broken. 1 could pass it on to whom-
ever requests it, but 1 won't. Since you are the terton's reincarnation, you should 
possess both lineages, so 1 will give the empowerment to you and you only:"64 

•Karmey Khenpo was that kind of person; added Tsikey Chokling when he told 
me the story. 

When it came to debating, Karmey Khenpo was a match even for Old 
Khyentse.65 Sometimes at the end of a philosophical argument, Karmey Khenpo 
would act like the big winner, and Khyentse would play at being depressed, as if 
he had lost something of immense value. Khyentse would bemoan his defeat and 
shed crocodile tears, making everyone laugh. 

There are many stories of Karmey Khenpo being thrashed by Old Khyentse. 
Once Khyentse even threw a torma at him, hitting him right in the head! 

But it was all an act they were staging, one that made it look as though they 
could almost never talk without getting into an argument. Seen from the outside, 
they seemed to be picking a fight with each other. But from the inside, for anyone 
who-really knew, they used this game to clarify subtle points of understanding, 
dispel hindrances and enhance progress on the path. 

63 



64 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

My teacher Samten Gyatso was one of Karmey Khenpo's disciples, and he told 
me many stories about him, such as the following. 

Once a year in Lhasa, a large tent was set up where all the major scholars, par-
ticularly from the three main monasteries-Sera, Ganden and Drepung-would 
gather to debate, to see who was the best that year. They would sit in rows of twen-
ty facing one another in front of the head of Ganden monastery, who sat on a large 
throne. Each debate was judged until one scholar emerged as the champion. 

One year, Karmey Khenpo happened to be in Lhasa at the time of these grand 
debates. He did not belong to any of the three prestigious participating monaster-
ies, but one morning he had a strong sense that he should go and join the debating 
contest. He announced this plan to his attendants. 

•Why do you want to do that?• one of them asked ·won't it inconvenience 
you?• This was a polite way of discouraging him-the attendant thought it would 
be embarrassing for Karmey Khenpo to lose. · 

•No, I must do it,• insisted the khenpo. •There's no way around it:' 
Karmey Khenpo then took a set of wooden plates of the kind used as book 

covers and tied them on his chest and back with some string. This was to sym-
bolize that his body was the scripture and that he embodied the Dharma. Then 
he tossed his monk's shawl over the wrong shoulder, held his rosary in the wrong 
hand and instead of wearing his hat with a peak like the other scholars, he flat-
tened it on top of his head. He visualized Chokgyur Lingpa at the crown of his 
head and himself as the Lion of Speech, a particular form of Padmasambhava 
indivisible from Manjushri. Confident that he was undefeatable, he entered the 
debate grounds. 

As his turn came, he beat one opponent after the other. When he had finally 
defeated them all, he found himself in front of the throne holder of Ganden, who 
declared, ·You have won-you are victorious!• 

This was quite an extraordinary feat; I doubt any Khampa had ever won before. 
Tradition has it that all one's opponents must lay their yellow hats on the ground 
and then the winner walks ~ver them as a sign of victory. But at that moment 
Karmey Khenpo thought, ·one is supposed to respect even the tiniest shred of 
religious robes, so if I trample these hats I will be breaking my vows:' 

So, instead of taking his ·victory march; he walked over into the shade, bowed 
his head, covered his face with his hand and slowly walked out. Still, he felt pretty 
good about himself, for not only had he beaten all the gcshe-scholars, but he had 
also upheld the precepts. 

Back in Kham, Karmey Khenpo met the great Khyentse, who was visiting 
Tsangsar Gompa at the time. After exchanging greetings, he said, •I have some 



Spiritual Sons 65 

really good news!• and proceeded to tell the story about the debate. He concluded 
by proudly stating, •And I didn't even walk on their yellow hats!• 

At that, I<hyentse snatched up one of his vajras and whacked Karmey I<henpo 
on the head with it. •you faint-hearted coward! Instead of clinging to the idea of 
monastic precepts, you could have made the Kagyu and Nyingma teachings fa-
mous. What happened to your I<hampa courage? Don't you have any confidence 
in-the view of the inner yogas? You're supposed to be a Vajrayana practitioner! 
Your body is a deity, your voice mantra and your mind samadhi, so how can you 
cling to such low attachments? You are an utter good-for-nothing!• 

Then he smacked him again. The khenpo slunk out and wasn't seen for a 
while. 

Just before his death, Karmey I<henpo said, •I<hyentse Rinpoche beat me again 
and again, sometimes even knocking me to the ground with all his slaps and 
thrashings. Time and time again he hauled me over the coals. But by beating me 
he removed the obstacles to a long life; now I'm so old I can't see-and I'm still 
unable to die!· 

It sounded like a complaint when he said it, but actually it was praise. 

Karmey I<henpo lived, I believe, into his early eighties and passed away at his 
hermitage above Karma Gon. He was then reborn as the son of my aunt. 

There had been a prediction from the Lotus-Born master that both Karmey 
Khenpo and Kongtrul would manifest the rainbow body at the time of death, a 
sign of great realization. Perhaps it was due to their extensive efforts to benefit 
others-they were always busy with their many disciples-that neither ended up 
manifesting the rainbow body. 

There are many factors involved in whether a practitioner attains the rainbow 
body. Karmey Khenpo, for instance, did reach the level at which all mental phe-
nomena dissolve back into the basic nature of reality: the exhaustion of concepts 
and phenomena. But even though at that exalted level he should have displayed 
the rainbow body-the outward sign of this state of realization-he did not do 
so. 

Likewise, the terma revelations of Chokgyur Lingpa predicted that Kongtrul 
would leave in a rainbow body when he passed away. But this was prevented 
because his activities on behalf of sentient beings were too encompassing. One 
major reason for this is that when there are a lot of disciples, then there are sure 
to be some broken samayas by some of them; broken samayas have consequenc-
es for the teacher and so can prevent the manifestation of a rainbow body. The 



66 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

17. 
KingJah-

the master of 

tantric teachings describe the •rainbow body with remainder: an occurrence that 
depends upon the purity of samaya of disciples and benefactors. 

But there are exceptions: not too long ago, Nyagla Perna Dudul attained the 
rainbow body when he died in the middle of his camp of five hundred disciples; 
it seems none of them managed to prevent it. Still, most other teachers with the 
same level of realization, and who have taught openly and widely to numerous 
disciples, typically do not attain a rainbow body, despite the possibility that they 
would have done so if they had had fewer students. 

That is probably why it is taught, •If you want to attain the rainbow body, don't 
have too many disciples7 

WANGCHOK DORJE 

Wangchok Dorje was one of Chokgyur Lingpa's three children. One of our chant 
texts describes him as the •magical display• of King Jah, meaning that he was a 
reincarnation of the Indian king who, right after the Buddha's passing, received 
the Eighteen Mahayoga Tantras from Vajrapani, the timeless lord of the tantric 
teachings. Wangchok Dorje and my grandmother, Konchok Paldron, were born 
from the same mother, Lady Degah. The mother of the third child, Tsewang 
Norbu, was a niece of Old Khyentse. 

After chanting hundreds of thousands of Manjushri mantras, and due to his 
training in former lives, Wangchok Dorje developed an incredibly sharp intel-
ligence; his insights left people speechless. I have been told that his realization-
where he was on the path and the levels he attained-was higher than even that of 

his terton father. Wangchok Dorje was still very 
young when, entirely on his own, he spontane-
ously recognized the nature of mind. 

Later, when people would ask him for medi-
tation teachings, he would reply, ·rm not the 
kind of person who can. guide you to the nature 
of mind. I didn't get up on the roof by climbing 
the stairs one at a time. I got here in one leap. 
Even if I were to describe my meditation state, 
you wouldn't be able to grasp it7 

Mahayoga IL-___ _......_"'-~---'--' 

It had been prophesied that Wangchok Dorje 
would reveal all the remaining termas among the 



Spiritual Sons 

New Treasures that hadn't yet been revealed by his father and ensure their propa-
gation. He was of that caliber. 

From childhood he could see the magical script of the dakinis as though it 
were right in front of his eyes and he could transcribe it, along with the connected 
teachings, at will, as they arose in the expanse of his mind. But despite the proph-
ecy, this ability was never put to its fullest use. 

People found Wangchok Dorje incredibly handsome; some even said he had 
the features of a god and that they had never seen anyone so beautiful. He was 
quite tall and very strong, with a noble bearing. His hair was very unusual; he wore 
it long, braided and wrapped around his head. It was described as a "magnetizing 
tiara; which meant that it had never been cut and that a dakini dwelled in every 
strand. His hair shone with a dark blue luster and when he washed it, it never 
tangled, even if he didn't comb it. 

Being both the son and the lineage holder of Chokgyur Lingpa, Wangchok 
Do* by tradition was supposed to have sons to carry on the family and the lin-
eage. People say he had one hundred lovers. Wherever he went, word went around 
that girls who wanted a "body connection"-a very physical blessing-with the 
handsome tulku could just come by to see him. The young women would literally 
line up, waiting at his quarters each evening. 

But Wangchok Dorje was also an accomplished yogi who had reversed the flow 
of the white essence and, unlike ordinary men, who ejaculate, he never made any-
one pregnant. I don't know whether this was good or bad, but that's the way it 
happened. On the other hand, how often in the old days did you hear of someone 
who had one hundred girlfriends, yet never made even one of them pregnant? 

Chokgyur Lingpa had immense confidence in the great master Paltrul and 
all his children-including Wangchok Dorje-became Paltrul's disciples. After 
Chokgytir Lingpa passed away, Wangchok Dorje journeyed to Paltrul's encamp-
ment Since many of his disciples were masters in their own right, it was said 
throughout Kham that his camp was like a den of snow lions, who later spread the 
roar of the sacred Dharma in all directions. 

Being the son of the great terton, Wangchok Dorje arrived at the camp with 
great pomp and circumstance, on horseback and with a large retinue. 

By contrast, Paltrul was a dedicated monk and of course had no consort. 
Rather, he would often speak about being "a child of the mountains, wearing the 

67 



68 SPIRITUAL RooTs 

mountain mist as one's garments" and about the virtues of following the simple 
lifestyle of the early practitioners of the Kagyu lineage. 

One day, Paltrul spoke of following their example by giving up elaborate in-
volvements. "To practice the true Dharma, one should always take the lower seat 
and wear castaway clothing; Paltrul told the gathering. "It has never been said that 
one should put oneself above others and dress up in brocade~ 

Inspired, Wangchok Dorje thought, "That's fine by me!" So he shed all his bro-
cade garments and wore a simple cloak made of inexpensive felt instead. He also 
dismissed his entourage and sent all his horses back to Chokgyur Lingpa's mon-
astery, keeping but a single attendant. He then shaved off all his hair and took 
monk's vows from Paltrul. He remained there for three years, having abandoned 
all possessions. 

But after he took the pledge to be a wandering renunciate with no possessions 
and had shaved off all of his wondrous hair, his majestic presence and splendor 
faded; he became just like an ordinary person. He turned pale and frail, and his 
back started to bend. 

This austere way of life seemed to have a very negative effect on his status as 
the holder of the terma teachings. In particular, cutting off his hair broke a sa-
maya bond with the dakinis. In order for a terton to transcribe the sign script of 
a terma, the syllables have to hover clearly in his vision. But now, he found, they 
were blurred, darted about, and became smaller and smaller. As a result, he was 
unable to decode and write down a single terma. 

Wangchok Dorje's journey home was in stark contrast to his imposing arriv-
al-in his father's fashion-in the company of forty horsemen and a herd of yaks. 
Instead, he walked on foot all the way from Golok in the northeastern part of 
Kham, carrying only a staff like a mendicant beggar. He traveled with just two 
attendants and a single hornless yak as pack animal. All they carried were a few 
books and the makings for tea. 

As they were walking down toward Dzongsar monastery in Derge, Wangchok 
Dorje fell ill. It must have been quite a severe illness, because in only five or six 
days he passed away at Khyentse's mountain retreat, the famous Gathering Palace 
ofSugatas. No one in the world could prevent this sad event. A procession carried 
the body back to Chokgyur Lingpa's seat. The terton's cook Perna Trinley, whom I 
knew as a small kid, was present when Wangchok Dorje passed away. He was then 
the monastery's bursar and got stuck with the task of delivering the sad news to 
the great Khyentse, who was staying nearby. 



Spiritual So11s 69 

Perna Trinley, who passed away near the age of ninety, gave me every detail of 
this story. Upon hearing of Wangchok Dorje's death, Khyentse was deeply dis-
pleased. Feeling that there had been no need for the son of a realized ngakpa to cut 
his hair," he cried out: •oamn! Crazy Paltrul made Wangchok Dorje cut his hair 
and turned him into a renunciate-and now look what has happened! How tragic! 
This proves how little merit there is in the present age of decline. Padmasambhava 
himself made the prophecy that this son of the terton would have spread his 
termas from the Chinese border in the east all the way to Mount Kailash in the 
west, benefiting beings like unfurling an immense sheet of white cloth. Now crazy 
Paltrul has messed everything up!• 

Khyentse then slapped his fists against his chest, expressing despair in typical 
Khampa fashion. •The auspicious coincidence didn't hold up: he moaned with a 
very morose expression. •He was supposed to be the one to reveal and propagate 
the remaining termas;67 

Perna Trinley presented an offering on behalf of the deceased and said, 
"Rinpoche, please give us an indication of where we can find his rebirth. I have 
'given you an offering and I need to return with the information; 

"Goodness!· replied Khyentse. ·Before they were sister and brother; now they 
may be son and mother; 

The great Khyentse continued to look upset and beat his chest. That was all he 
said by way of prediction. 

No more than a year had passed when Khyentse confirmed that in fact my 
grandmother Konchok Paldron's newborn son was Wangchok Dorje's reincarna-
tion. 

"Listen up!• Old Khyentse said. •Isn't it true that Konchok Paldron has just giv-
en birth to a boy? I tell you, there is no doubt that he is Wangchok Dorje!• 

Then Old Khyentse ratified it in writing. 
Old Khyentse continued, •Her second son doesn't have a long life, but naming 

him Immortal Vajra will provide an auspicious circumstance for prolonging his 
life~ And that is how my father got his name: Chimey Dorje. 

Chokgyur Lingpa's collected works-apart from the forty volumes of his ter-
mas-comprised two volumes and Wangchok Dorje's writings a single thick vol-
ume. Both had been laboriously written out by hand rather than printed with 
woodblocks. I kept one copy of both these collections. After I left for Central Tibet, 
I wrote my monastery asking them to send me these texts. Later I heard that the 
caretakers of my monastery refused to send anything of value.68 You might wonder 



70 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

what they were thinking! The precious handwritten texts were left in Kham, but 
what was the use? This is what happens when woodblocks aren't made! 

A few years after the Otinese invasion, news went around of a coming boon 
to humankind: something called a •cultural revolution:' This deceit was what the 
hordes of liars who followed the invading soldiers propagated. Sure enough, when 
the wave of the Cultural Revolution swept over our country, enormous changes 
occurred: our monasteries were destroyed and all our literature was reduced to 
ashes. 

Wangchok Dorje's writings were probably destroyed, as most Buddhist scrip-
tures were thrown into the flames. The Chinese communists were so menacing 
that they were able to coerce the villagers to gather all their books and toss them 
into a big fire. Then the occupation officials announced, ·From this moment on· 
ward, if we find a single book in your house, the owner will be hanged. Each vol· 
ume of scripture shall cost one life:' 

At that, many frightened people threw their precious books into the rivers. 
But some were buried in the ground with the hope that they would one day be 
retrieved-but when they were later dug up unfortunately they had rotted away. 
Still, our country is so huge that 1 wonder if some won't eventually turn up.69 In 
fact, one very beautiful text that Wangchok Dorje wrote when he was only sixteen, 
called Inexhaustible Garland of Lightnin& did survive; we still use it daily in our 
monasteries. How wonderful it would be if even just a few more like that have 
survived. 

TSEWANG NORBU 

Tsewang Norbu's mother was Old Khyentse's niece."' The Lotus-Born master 
had also foretold that this consort would give birth to a reincarnation of Yudra 
Nyingpo.7• 

Since the Three Sections was the heart essence of Vairotsana, it was entrust-
ed to his foremost disciple in Kham, Yudra Nyingpo. That is also why Yudra 
Nyingpo's reincarnation, Tsewang Norbu, had to be the first to receive the em-
powerment. As Padmasambhava's prophecies tend to be very precise, it was 
even predicted in the terma itself that ·within one to three years he should be 
given this terma:'1a 

Tsewang Norbu was quite humble; he once told Samten Gyatso, •rm nothing 
special, not at all. 1 don't have any great qualities, not a single one, except for one 



Spiritual Sons 

thing: even though I was just six months old at the time, I clearly remember re-
ceiving the Three Sections from the two great treasure masters~ As a matter of fact, 
the Three Sections had just then been revealed." 

Twenty-five people were present at this event, including Khyentse and Karmey 
Khenpo. The moment the terma was revealed Chokgyur Lingpa called out to the 
child's mother, "Bring the kid here!" 

She brought the baby over, wrapped in blankets, and sitting on a tray of woven 
reeds covered with a layer of dried sheep droppings and then with a couple of lay-
ers of cloth. This was all in typical Khampa style for an infant, leaving the child free 
to pee whenever need be. 

Tsewang Norbu sat right between Khyentse and Chokling while he received the 
empowerment. Chokgyur Lingpa first conferred the empowerment on the baby 
and only then upon Khyentse. But because of the command that this empower-
ment only be given one on one, no one else received it-not even Kongtrul. That 
is also why the many lineages for the Three Sections all went through Tsewang 
Norbu. Later on, he came to be the one who did the most to ensure the propaga-
tion of Chokgyur Lingpa's termas.7• 

Until Tsewang Norbu was about a year old, an eagle perched on the roof of his 
parents' house every single day. Later, the great Khyentse said this was the Eagle-
Wmged Goddess who guards the Three Sections. 

Like his siblings, Tsewang Norbu was a disciple of the great Paltrul. Once in 
Kham, he had gone up on the mountainside near Paltrul's encampment to spend 
ten days in a cave. As he didn't intend to stay long, he only took a small bag of 
tsampa with him. 

One night, there was a heavy snowfall and he was snowed in. The snow kept 
falling and falling. He failed to return; after a couple of months, word spread in 
Paltrul's camp that Tsewang Norbu must have passed away. Finally, his death was 
taken for granted, and virtuous actions were done in his name, including the tra-
ditional burnt offerings of food to nurture the spirit of the deceased. 

Six months later, the snow finally thawed. One day, someone let out a scream: 
Tsewang Norbu's corpse was walking into camp! People began scattering right 
and left to get out of its way, afraid of being touched by the rolang, a Tibetan-style 
zombie. 

"Don't worry. it's just me!" Tsewang tried to assure them. 
Fmally, after things settled down, someone had the chance to ask, "How is it 

you didn't starve to death?" 

71 



72 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

•Why would I starve to death?" he replied, ·When I was thirsty I ate snow and 
when hungry I ate from my bag of tsampa. You don't starve if you have provi-
sions~ 

Later he explained that he had survived on a mere spoonful of tsampa a day. In 
other words, he wouldn't admit to a thing. The truth was he had attained mastery 
in yoga, including full control over the subtle channels and energies, and so he 
probably spent most of the time in samadhi.75 

He also mentioned one interesting point, •It seems there is good reason to burn 
offerings of tsampa and other foodstuffs during the seven weeks after someone's 
demise. I personally found it quite helpful as I felt neither hungry nor cold during 
those forty-nine days. Even inside my cave I could sometimes smell the smoke 
from the offerings being made for me at the monastery~ 

Tsewang Norbu was also extremely learned-the equal of Karmey Khenpo. He 
claimed that his scholarship was merely due to spending his early years with the 
great Khyentse. As Tsewang Norbu was Old Khyentse's grandnephew, he could 
easily spend long periods of time with the master. So Tsewang Norbu received 
most of his early teachings at the feet of Khyentse. 

•staying with Khyentse when I was young made me a wealthy man-rich with 
teachings; he would say. ·old Khyentse didn't teach much during the day; he pre-
ferred just to relax with his disciples. At best, you might be able to ask a question or 
two during the day. But when evening fell and everyone heard the ring of the bell. 
they would gather at his hermitage. The empowerment began during the night. 

•An hour or so before dawn, he would say, 'Now it's time for the old man to get 
some sleep. You better go and do the same: Only then would all of us disciples 
leave his room~ 

Tsewang Norbu was eccentric and, like many a yogi, spontaneous and direct. 
One distinctive peculiarity of his was never to do what a dignitary or high lama 
told him to. For instance, not even Khakyab Dorje, the fifteenth Karmapa, had 
been able to force Tsewang Norbu to give him the transmissions for the New 
Treasures. 

The Karmapa's attendant and dose disciple Jampal Tsultrim was an important 
teacher in his own right, as well as one of the chief disciples of the Karmapa. So 
Karmapa chose him to go to Lhasa, to try his best to compel Tsewang Norbu to 
give the sought-after empowerments. 



Spiritual Sons 

"Since you're the son of Chokgyur Lingpa, the Karmapa is sending you this 
white scarf and telling you to give him the transmissions: he said. 

"No way!• Tsewang Norbu replied, ·oo you want a dog to put a paw on a hu-
man's head? You're talking nonsense. Don't even bring it up, you little monk~76 

Thus, he compared the Karmapa to a mere human being and himself to a dog-
and even called this important and famous lama •little monk~ In short, Tsewang 
Norbu couldn't be coerced by anyone. 

Jampal Tsultrim later said he had ·never met anyone as stubborn as Tsewang 
Norbu. Karmapa is Avalokiteshvara in the flesh, so who wouldn't rejoice in giving 
him Chokgyur Lingpa's termas as an offering?• But Tsewang Norbu still wouldn't 
cave in to such pressure. 

Some years later, Sam ten Gyatso (who was Tsewang Norbu's nephew,) went to 
Central Tibet to fulfill the Karmapa's wish . 

. Tsewang Norbu was a monk during the first half of his life, but that didn't last. 
At one point Old Khyentse told him, ·You must go to Mindrolling and stay there~ 
So off he went, staying for eight years in one of the most important centers for 
learning in Central Tibet. 

Despite his standing as the only living son of the great terton, Tsewang Norbu's 
style was to arrive unannounced, without the slightest pomp. So he enrolled at 
Mindrolling as a common monk to pursue his studies. But he must have made 
himself count somehow, since we find his name in the records of lineage masters 
who transmitted important teachings at Mindrolling. Without him, those teach-
ings might have been lost . 

. Tsewang Norbu was not pushy, and he was a monk at heart-so during those 
eight years at Mindrolling the thought of marrying the head lama's daughter never 
even entered his mind. So despite the terma prophecy, after eight years he re-
turned to Kham, still a monk. 

But when he returned to Kham, he was scolded by Khyentse: ·You useless 
good-for-nothing, you didn't do your job!• 

"What do you mean I didn't do my job! 
"A descendant of Chokgyur Lingpa was supposed to replenish the bloodline at 

Mindrolling. That's why I sent you! But you're useless!· 77 

"How am I supposed to replenish their bloodline? They are humans, but I am 
just a dog. It never occurred to me that humans and dogs marry~ 

Still, Old Khyentse was set on Chokgyur Lingpa's son having descendants one 
way or another. So he forced Tsewang Norbu to give back his monk's vows and 

73 



74 SPIRITUAL RooTs 

become a ngakpa. Moreover, Khyentse arranged for him to have a consort from a 
devoted family, but they didn't have any children. 

After that, another consort from a family in Derge was arranged, still with the 
same lack of results. 

Sometimes Tsewang Norbu would complain with his wry sense of humor, 
•oarn! I'm totally useless. I didn't keep the monastic precepts and so I'm a fallen 
monk. But I also haven't produced any children. My life has been wasted-l'm a 
total failure!• 

Some lamas, hearing this, would become quite unsettled by his deadpan hu-
mor. And in Nangchen there is now a saying about being ·as useless as Tsewang 
Norbu• and not accomplishing any worldly or spiritual achievements. 

In the later part of his life, Tsewang Norbu went to live in Central Tibet, where 
he became known for his strange behavior. While he was there, it happened that 
the thirteenth Dalai Lama went to lndia.71 One sign of Tsewang Norbu's status 
was that the Tibetan government in Lhasa requested him to perform a ritual for 
repelling foreign invasions. He performed it meticulously at the Ramoche temple 
in Lhasa, which contains one of the two most famous Jowo statues in all of Tibet 

Although Tsewang Norbu had held the position of a very high lama in Kham, 
after going to Central Tibet he changed his ways radically. He would often invite 
beggars in for tea, long conversations and a few laughs-he was that kind of mas-
ter. And in other ways he was known to act contrary; as the saying goes, •If they 
said HUNG, he would say PHAT:" 

He usually wore a very simple sheepskin coat. But one day he put on a fine 
brocade robe. •Rinpoche, why are you dressing up like thatr his servant asked. 
•you never dress up:" 

·Quiet!• Tsewang Norbu said. ·Today we are going to meet the king of all tan-
tric yogis in this world:" 

•And who might that be?• the servant asked. 
•Khakyab Dorje, the Karmapa; was the reply. ·rm supposed to be a ngakpa, so 

today is a good day to dress the part:" 
And he rode off to Tsurphu with great dignity. But the moment they got back 

to Lhasa, he immediately put his sheepskin coal back on. 

When he was quite old, head chanter Trinley, who had been one of Tsewang 
Norbu's disciples, told me the following story: 



Spiritual Sons 75 

"Sometimes I just couldn't understand what Tsewang Norbu was up to-I even 
wondered whether my teacher had gone crazy or something. Early one morning, 
Tsewang Norbu declared, 'Today we arc going to hold a great feast! Go to the meat 
market and invite as many slaughterhouse shepherds as you can: 

"These particular slaughterhouse shepherds were a motley crew; they were very 
poor and quite grimy. Their only job was to lead animals to the chopping block. 
After a while, fifty or sixty of them were standing in the courtyard. In the mean-
time, Tsewang Norbu's disciples had set up a large table for food. 

"Tsewang Norbu came out and told them all to sit down in lines, as if they were 
monks in a temple. First they were served a lavish meal, with Tsewang Norbu sit-
ting right there among them, at the head of the row. He then asked for a text and, 
while they were all sitting in line eating, he started chanting the liturgy for the 
terma Embodiment of Realization." 

"These shepherds, to say the least, were unused to sitting in an organized group 
practice like a bunch of monks. They were trapped there, fidgeting a lot-but nev-
ertheless enjoying the food. 

"At the end, after the guests had left, I asked, 'What are you up to, Rinpoche? 
In all of Lhasa, there are no worse people than those guys-they are the ones who 
lead the animals to slaughter. They push the poor animals the last few steps and 
afterwards help chop up the wretched animals' carcasses. Why are you spending 
so much money on people like thatr 

•Hey! Don't talk like that; Tsewang Norbu replied. 'Today I performed the feast 
offering in the company of several perfect bodhisattvas. Besides me, who has the 
merit to do so these days? I don't have a flicker of doubt about this. Today was an 
auspicious day:" 

That's just one example of the strange kinds of things Tsewang Norbu would 
do. 

Tsewang Norbu also had amazing clairvoyant powers-to such an extent that 
he frightened people. Trinley, the head chanter, also told me this story: 

One day, Tsewang Norbu went to perform a big smoke offering ritual for 
~e longevity of a household in Lhasa. The father of the house had great faith in 
Tsewang Norbu; at the end of the ceremony he approached and asked, •I wonder 
how our luck and health will be next year:' 

"Oh. yeah! Your luck and health?• Tsewang Norbu proclaimed, •you11 be dead 
next year and not one month will pass before your wife will be dead too:' 

"But what about our son? What will he do?· the man gasped. 



76 SPIRITUAL RooTs 

·He won't stay here without you; he'll be distraught and leave. Next year your 
house will be empty; Tsewang Norbu declared. 

·oh, no, here he goes again!" Trinley thought to. himself, •Why did he have to 
go and do that? This is so inauspicious~ 

The following year, Trinley heard that the man had died, then about a month 
later that the wife had died and, finally, that the son had left, leaving the house 
empty. 

Though I never met him when I was young I saw a photograph of Tsewang 
Norbu that had been taken in Bhutan; it hung in Samten Gyatso's private room 
at Fortress Peak. He was tall and stout like Dilgo Khyentse, and he was strikingly 
handsome. 

At Tsikey monastery, Tsewang Norbu would often go for a walk outside by 
himself; in the afternoon he could be seen sitting for long stretches of time near 
the bank of the Kechu River. eo 

As a young boy, my father and some friends once saw the imposing frame of a 
man sitting very straight and alone by the river. My father, the leader of this gang 
of small monks, made a proposal: 

•This big guy comes here every day to kill the poor fish. Let's hit him on the 
head with a stone to teach him a lesson. Keep quiet now .• :' 

They snuck closer-but just when they were about to throw the stone, Tsewang 
Norbu gave a loud cough, almost as though in warning. They immediately recog-
nized who it was and fled in all directions. 

·u he hadn't coughed, I would surely have hit him right in the neck," my father 
later said. •I was that wild. If it hadn't been for Tsewang Norbu's clairvoyance, I 
would have been responsible for hitting him with a stone! How would I have lived 
with that?" 

A lot of what we now call Chokgyur Lingpa's termas actually appeared through 
the combined efforts of Khyentse, Kongtrul and the terton himself. They passed a 
lot of transmissions among themselves, but all these streams merged in Tsewa'ng 
Norbu. 

Once Khyentse and Kongtrul were requested to confer the empowerments for 
the Treasury of Precious Termas at Riwoche monastery, in the Chamdo province 
between Lhasa and Kham. Riwoche was a major center for the Dharma, so this 
was no small occasion. 



Spiritual Sons 

"The Treasury is the quintessence of all the terma revelations of the hundred 
major tertons; the lamas at Riwoche repeatedly insisted. ·we must receive this 
transmission.• 

When told that Khyentse couldn't come, they asked Kongtrul instead. But both 
Khyentse and Kongtrul were too old at this point. So the two masters discussed 
the invitation with each other and agreed to send Tsewang Norbu as their substi-
tute.'J 

Tsewang Norbu went to Riwoche and transmitted the entire Treasury of Precious 
Termas. At the end, he continued right on transmitting all the New Treasures. The 
two reincarnations of Chokgyur Lingpa-Tsikey Chokling and Neten Chokling-
both attended, as did Samten Gyatso and Uncle Tersey. 

One of the last empowerments was for the Three Sections of the Great Peifection. 
Prior to conferring it, Tsewang Norbu said, ·The Three Sections cannot be given 
in public nor even in small, private groups. There is a strict command of secrecy, 
the breaking of which will have severe consequences-as dangerous as picking 
something from inside the mouth of a poisonous viper. I can only give it to one of 
you at a time~ 

He then made each of them hold on to his shawl and swear an oath, telling 
them, "You must only pass this sacred teaching on as a lineage restricted to a 
single recipient at a time!· 

Tsewang Norbu also told the lamas, •After my death, people will search for my 
reincarnation. It may happen that someone will try to pin my name onto some un-
fortunate bardo spirit who has been floundering around and has just managed to 
come into a human body for the first time in a long while. Doing so will ensure his 
rebirth in the lower realms with no chance of escape. Don't search for my tulku! 

"If my next incarnation does serve Chokgyur Lingpa's teachings, he will do so 
either directly or indirectly. You should definitely not try to find him! Take hold of 
my shawl and promise me that, all four of you!• He emphatically prohibited any 
recognition of his tulku, and so the four of them had no choice but to swear not to 
look for one after his death. 

None of his main disciples dared to try to find him. I have heard that there have 
been some attempts lately to find a present incarnation, but thinking of that oath, 
I personally wouldn't dare to ask any master for his location. 

When he died, Tsewang Norbu was staying in Nyemo in the district of Tsang, 
to the west of Lhasa. I believe he was in his sixties. Just before his death, he told 
his attendant, ·The main seat of my brother and me was Tsikey monastery. Send

aU my possessions there together with this note. And while you are at it, you might 
as well take along any bones from my cremated body. 

•1 have managed to compile a complete set of the New Treasures, so do not let 
anyone pilfer from it. My father's reincarnation, as well as my brother's rebirth, 
both live at Tsikey-you must hand-deliver this collection directly to them. And 
this note is my final will and testament. I do not have a single word to add besides 
what is written here, except that you must spread the word that 'Tsewang Norbu 
died like an old dog in a village called Nyemo: Promise me that this is what you 
will answer if anyone should ask about me. Spread this message far and wide to all 
the lamas back in Kham." 

Tsewang Norbu's personal copies of the New Treasures, his icons and his imple-
ments for empowerments were all kept at Tsikey until the Cultural Revolution. 

Those who were present at his cremation were amazed to see a ray of rainbow-
colored light extending from the funeral pyre to a point distant in the sky. I don't 
remember if there were any relic pills in his ashes, but 1 heard that some of his 
bones were filled with sindhura powder-I'm not sure anyone would call that •dy-
ing like an old dog:'

My Precious Grandmother 

My grandmother, Konchok Paldron, was an unusually gifted person, very talented 
and wise. In our region, women were rarely educated as well as she was. It was 
hard to find anyone so accomplished in so many ways. 

Grandmother knew all the chants and melodies as well as the correct use of 
ritual implements, having learned them directly from the terton himself, who of-
ten received these melodies in his visions. If it weren't for her, the authentic tunes 
and procedures of our lineage would have been lost. She even knew the special 
ways of blowing the gyaling trumpets. Grandmother was extremely skilled at us-
ing the gyaling and everyone at Tsikey who was learning to play it would ask for 
her critique. 

·She also transmitted the complex mudras for each of the hundred peaceful 
and wrathful deities, and the rituals connected to them, which she had learned 
at MindroUing monastery according to the thousand-year-old oral tradition. Her 
grasp of ritual tunes and the use of musical instruments remains the backbone of 
the New Treasures to this day. 

Grandmother was also a respected herbal doctor who dispensed medicine to 
patients every day. She was an astrologer as well and an expert in several painting 
styles.h She was extraordinary. 

Grandmother overcame any and all disadvantages of being a woman in our 
male-dominated Khampa culture. She was so impressive that there were no other 
women like her around where I grew up. 

My first strong memories of my grandmother go back to when I was around 
seven years old, and she was staying at our family home, the Tsangsar mansion. 
I went to see her almost every day during those three years. My face must have 
had a darker, bluish tinge in those days for she nicknamed me Blue Face. She 



80 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

nicknamed my older half-brother Penjik, Pale Face, because of his light com· 
plexion. 

Later, Grandmother moved to a small nearby chapel for a year and then farther 
away to lofty Fortress Peak, where she spent three years with her son Samten 
Gyatso. During that time, I wasn't able to see her much, since I had gone to sta)' 
with my father at his retreat place, Dechen Ling, which was two days' journey on 
horseback. She was very generous, always giving me gifts like dried apricots, small 
bags and other things. She also taught me proper table manners and how to be-
have in the company of others. 

My father was the only son to produce grandchildren and, as I seemed to be her 
favorite, she lavished me with affection. She would regularly keep me with her to 
chat and would often share her tsampa with me-passing me small morsels that I 
would sit and wait for, then happily gobble up. She loved me as though I were her 
own child. 

There was no one who knew the art of torma making as well as Grandmother 
did. It was really she who taught me how to make the tormas for the New Treasures. 
Because of her, I had so much experience with rituals that I later served as my 
father's shrine master for many years. Although I was still in my teens, he put me 
in charge of preparing all the necessary objects for the rituals. 

The tormas were my particular responsibility; I can't count how many tormas I 
made as a teenager. I had first begun to learn the art of torma making from Penjik, 
who was quite deft with his hands. But there inevitably comes a point in the art of 
torma making when adjustments and refinements are necessary, so I would go to 
my uncle Sang-Ngak, who taught me many of the finer points. But when Samten 
Gyatso brought me along to Tsikey, he told me, ·The ultimate arbiter of Chokgyur 
Lingpa's torma style is your grandmother:" 

One day, she gave me her stamp of approval. When my buddy Dudul and I 
showed her our tormas, she told me, •While Dudul's style leans more toward the 
Mindrolling tradition, yours follows purely the New Treasures. In the future, you 
can be the backbone of our ritual lineage:" · 

When I was nineteen, I went to visit her at Tsikey. She would have been about 
seventy years old by then and was slightly ill. I stayed about two months and 
received the final teachings from her on how to make tormas. At the end of the 
two months, I had become quite adept at making all the different tormas used 
in the rituals for the New Treasures and received Konchok Paldron's personal 
blessing. She told me, •You are actually the best torma maker in this terma tradi· 



My Precious Grandmother 

tion~ Today I have no special qualities at all, except I really know how to make 
those tormas. 

My grandmother's way of correcting people was not by scolding or rebuke; 
instead she would give advice on ·what a good person would do.· It was then up to 
you to decide to act accordingly. 

I never saw or heard of her striking anyone. I remember her saying to us chil-
dren, ·using small lies as jokes to tease people is not a virtue, but hurtful and 
wrong. Don't tease in a mean way. Don't bicker.• 

She would make small suggestions like, ·oon't talk with food in your mouth. 

Eat gently and quietly. When you talk, don't yawn or make other unnecessary 
sounds. Don't raise your voice without cause; you don't have to yell when you are 
talking to the person next to you. Speak like a gentleman: take the time to find the 
right words, then speak. By rushing you only end up sounding like a lunatic~ 

Such was the sort of advice she gave me as a small child. Every single time I 
went to see her, I got some such guidance. 

Despite her noble heritage, my grandmother-or Precious Mother, as we ad-
dressed her-was incredibly humble, always taking the lower seat. Various lamas 
and important disciples of her father came to pay her their respects. Invariably 
she would say, ·There is no need for you to come and see this old lady. What has 
gotten into you lamasr 

The only way anyone could bow to her was by doing so outside her room, before 
entering. She would never remain seated as they greeted her with joined palms; if 
they bowed down she would get up and move away, saying, •What kind of lamas 
are you-bowing down to this old woman?· 

While Grandmother was living at Fortress Peak, the lamas from Gebchak, the 
impressive nunnery nearby, would come to pay their respects to the daughter of 
the great terton. Samten Gyatso would enter her room to announce which lama 
had come and she would say, •Why are they here? There's nothing they can get 
from me. Don't even bring it up again! They don't need to meet me~ 

Of course, Sam ten Gyatso couldn't tell an important lama to just go away, so he 
would arrange some seating for them in the meadow and then invite Grandmother 
to come outside and enjoy the weather. The lama was then told to approach slowly, 
from the other side, as if just strolling by, and then they could begin a conversa-
tion. Otherwise, there was no way to meet her; she was simply too humble. 

81 



82 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

Maybe her sincere humility was the reason the Chokling of Tsikey, who com-
piled Chokgyur Lingpa's biography, could find no way to approach her, let alone 
hear her stories. Whatever the reason, he didn't tap her memory when writing the 
official version of the terton's life story. 

Despite all the great masters she met earlier in her life, Konchok Paldron's root 
guru was her own son, Samten Gyatso. He was the one who gave her the essen-
tial meditation instructions. Of course she had received transmissions from other 
masters, including her brother Wangchok Dorje, who passed away at an early age. 
But it was Samten Gyatso who pointed out mind essence to her so that she recog-
nized it unmistakenly- and that defines a root guru. 

This is quite astounding if you think about it: her own son! 
Sam ten Gyatso told me that he was amazed by his mother's level of meditation. 

When her life was drawing to a close, she had reached the level known as collapse 
of delusion, at which point there are no more dreams during sleep; the dream state 
is totally purified. Indeed, the tantric scriptures mention that at a certain point 
the stream of dreaming ceases, so that throughout day and night the continuity of 
luminous wakefulness is no longer interrupted. 

She was truly amazing! People often said that their trivial thoughts and worries 
would immediately subside the moment they entered her room. One would feel 
very lucid and quiet. It was extraordinarily palpable. 

This daughter of Chokgyur Lingpa was unusual in so many ways. For instance, 
she had three visions in which she met Tara as if in person- as though they were 
just having a conversation. This was not public knowledge, as she never men-
tioned a thing to anyone but my uncle Samten Gyatso. She didn't even tell me 

herself; I heard it from him. 
The local people trusted her deeply. They 

would often ask for some grains of barley she 
had blessed, to carry in a small amulet bag on 
their body. They would also tie her protection 
amulets around the necks of their goats and 
sheep. Some people even tested whether her 
protection actually worked by shooting rifles at 
their goats. 

•Each time I hit the goat,• one of them told 
me, ·after the impact it would cry out in pain, 
·saaaaah!" But on closer inspection, I couldn't 



My Precious Grandmother 83 

find a bullet wound anywhere. The amulet made my goat bulletproof-and I'm 
not lying!• 

This test was perhaps not so bad; it made people trust in her protection. 

Konchok Paldron also remembered once traveling with her mother to Old 
Khyentse's main residence in Derge, when Khyentse, Kongtrul and Chokling were 
all still alive. 

The three masters performed an elaborate drubchen practice together-con-
tinuing for nine days and nights without interruption-probably using the terma 
known as Embodiment of Realization . ., She and her brother Wangchok Dorje sat 
in. When it came time for the feast, the great Khyentse said, •As an auspicious co-
incidence, you two siblings must wear the tantric ornaments and bring the plates 
offeast offerings:' 

Grandmother remembered the two of them standing up and holding the plates 
in front of the three masters while they were singing the slow and melodious feast 
song. •My brother looked like a little god; she recalled, •and he had such a beauti-
ful face-beyond beliefl· 

At the end, Old Khycntsc joined his palms and said, •These children are cer-
tainly the offspring of a vidyadhara lineage:' 

My grandmother also remembered meeting the great Paltrul 
Paltrul and her father, the terton, met at Dzogchen monastery in the neigh-

boring Derge kingdom. At the time, the tulku of Yongey Mingyur Dorje was the 
terton's attendant, serving him tea and cooking his meals. 

At dawn, Chokgyur Lingpa told him, •This morning the great master Paltrul 
Rinpoche is coming to see me. Please make special preparations:' 

A while later, when Yongey came out of the master's room after pouring him 
tea, he saw an old man at the door. Dressed in Golok style instead of lama's robes, 
he wore a simple sheepskin coat with the hairless side covered in red doth. He had 
a large frame and a prominent nose. 

"I must see Chokgyur Lingpa!• was all he said. Then he proceeded to walk in. 
As the terton's visitors never entered his quarters unannounced, Yongey 

blocked the door, saying, ·wait! Wait! It's not that easy. I must first announce you 
to the lama:' 

"Get out of my way!• the old man said and began to push Yongey aside. 
Yongey grabbed the old man's sleeve and insisted, ·vou can't just barge in like this:' 



84 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

The old man pulled in the opposite direction and they began to tussle. Suddenly 
Yongey thought to himself, ·Maybe this is not an ordinary old man from Golok. 
Perhaps I should go inside and ask:" 

What he had been told earlier about the day's visitor then dawned on him, but 
he had assumed that someone looking more like a great master would be coming. 

When he turned around, he discovered Chokgyur Lingpa there on the floor 
prostrating to the old man-who then began bowing down in return. Yongey later 
said that •after they bowed to each other, they touched heads like two yaks7 

The Dzogchen monastery had invited Chokgyur Lingpa to be a guest of honor, 
the recipient of auspicious offerings. Since Paltrul was then the master in resi· 
dence, he was asked to write the formal speech before the offerings. 

You can find this talk in Chokgyur Lingpa's life story. Extremely elegant, 
the speech showers the terton with praise, referring to him as the emissary of 
Padmasambhava. 

During this visit, the terton began to call Paltrul ·ozogchen Paltrul• -a name 
that stuck-and also gave him the empowerment for his terma containing teach· 
ings on the Great Perfection entitled Heart Essence ofSamantabhadra. This trans-
mission took place at the retreat center located high above the snow line overlook· 
ing the monastery's Shri Singha College. 

Conversely, Chokgyur Lingpa placed Paltrul on a high throne and received the 
Way of the Bodhisattva from him. So the two masters were definitely connected. 

My grandmother recalled that Tsewang Norbu wasn't there, but Wangchok 
Dorje was a witness, as was Chokgyur Lingpa's consort. 

Paltrul practiced this particular teaching on the Great Perfection and later said, 
•I am usually the type of person who gets no visions, signs, nor any other indica· 
tions of progress, but while practicing this terma something did happen, even for 
me. This teaching must be for real!• 

My grandmother could imitate Paltrul's strong Golok accent as she recit· 
ed what he said when giving mind teachings to an old man from that region: 
·when you don't follow the past and don't invite the future, there is nothing 
else to sustain but the uncontrived, unbridled and free state of your present, 
ordinary mind:" 

In that short statement, he had given the essential teaching of the Great 
Perfection. 

But the old man from Golok then pleaded, •Give me a blessing to ensure that I 
won't end up in the hell realms!• 



My Precious Grandmother 

But Paltrul merely replied, ·unless you take care of it yourself, no one else can 
send you to the pure lands, as though they were just flinging a stone:' 

My grandmother reached perfect realization before she passed away at eighty, 
quite an advanced age for someone in our region. One of my last memories is of 
her telling me, •I am leaving shortly. I want to leave my body at Tsikey, where my 
father's and brother's remains are kept:' 

Grandmother died at Tsikey a few years later. 
I didn't visit her much while she was there, but from time to time I did receive 

presents from her-small delicate boxes in various colors and other things young-
sters like. 

Grandmother left her body while sitting up very straight. I remember her cre-
mation, which was performed outside at a distance from Tsikey monastery itself. 
There was a large funeral pyre shaped like a stupa, in the traditional way. The head 
lama was Dzigar Kongtrul, a prominent lama in the region. During the crema-
tion, five separate groups performed elaborate sadhanas, each based on different 
mandalas. Afterward, we discovered large quantities of sindhura powder in the 
ashes.

My Guru, Samten Gyatso 

My grandmother's eldest son, Samten Gyatso, was my root guru and ultimate ref-
uge. He was also, of course, my uncle. I feel a bit shy telling stories about him. 
because 1 don't want to sound as if I'm indirectly praising myself by lauding a 
family member. A disciple who emphasizes signs of accomplishment, clairvoyant 
abilities and miraculous powers in stories about his own guru, may-instead of 
honoring him-end up discrediting him. Yet though he was a relative, there is no 
way I can avoid praising him. I don't mean to be crude, but I'm related to him like 
excrement is related to fine cuisine. 

I'm not just glorifying someone in my own family, like ·the lower lip praising 
the upper,· but, in all honesty, there was virtually no other master in Kham with 
such a high view and realization, with such commanding presence and majestic 
brilliance. I won't be able to tell you the inner or innermost versions of his life-as 
we customarily describe a person's spiritual experiences and realization-since I 
don't know them. But here is what I have heard or directly witnessed. 

When Samten Gyatso transmitted the New Treasures to the great master 
Tentrul at Surmang monastery, 1 slept near the door in Samten Gyatso's room. 
so I often witnessed their evening discussions. Tentrul was extremely learned and 
very noble. One day, he told me, ·Many years ago I met Sam ten Gyatso with your 
father, Chimey Dorje, in Derge, and even then I thought that due to his insight and 
lineage he would become a truly great scholar. I have studied many more philo-
sophical works than Sam ten Gyatso, but when we get to the topic of the Great 
Perfection, I almost don't dare to continue speaking. When we discuss the New 
Treasures, somehow 1 am able to keep up, but he puts me to shame when we start 
talking about meditation:' 

Within the Barom Kagyu lineage, Sam ten Gyatso was regarded as an emanation 
of Four-Armed Mahakala, one of the more prominent guardians of the Dharma." 



My Guru, Sam ten Gyatso 87 

Moreover, the second Chokling of Tsikey once had a vision of Samten Gyatso in 
which he saw him as an emanation of Vimalamitra. 

From the time I was young, I respected my guru deeply. In his conduct, Samten 
Gyatso kept the monastic precepts quite purely and strictly. He never tasted alco-
hol nor ate any meat. In his attitude, he was always in tune with the bodhisattva 
trainings. 

Some of us who were with him every day could be quite blind to his qualities, 
just like people in Lhasa who never go to see the Jowo statue of the Buddha, think-
ing there is plenty of time to get around to going. But if you paid attention to his 
personality, it was obvious that he was fully endowed with compassion, persever-
ance and devotion. 

Samten Gyatso never flattered others by playing up to them or telling them 
how wonderful they were. He spoke straightforwardly. If something was true, he 
would say so; if not, he would say it was not, without adding or subtracting any-
thing. He never talked around a sensitive topic. 

My guru was completely reliable, conscientious in all matters. If you got his 
word on something, you would never hear him say later that he had forgotten. 
That's the kind of man he was, extremely dependable. He was almost never sick-
or at least I never heard him complain, not even about having a headache or some 
other pain. Nor did he ever make plans for more than one day at a time and he 
always completed his tasks. 

Samten Gyatso was scrupulously attentive to all his daily affairs, both spiritual 
and secular. For instance, when giving empowerments, he never skipped a word 
or phrase. He would perform the entire ritual, from the preparation to the con-
. eluding verses, in a state of meditative composure, so that upon entering the room 
you got the feeling that you were about to receive an empowerment for real. That's 
the kind of teacher he was. 

Other people were intimidated by Samten Gyatso's meticulousness and, afraid 
of not living up to his standards, often felt unqualified to participate in rituals in 
his presence. You couldn't make a single mistake on a torma or leave out a single 
detail in a mandala arrangement on the shrine, because you somehow knew that 
he would not only detect it but find it unacceptable. You would be hard-pressed to 
find anyone more thorough-he was a true perfectionist! Novice lamas didn't dare 

· put on airs when he presided over a ceremony. 
· Samten Gyatso was so learned and skilled, so trustworthy and matchless, that 
people compared him to Marpa, the master translator who brought the Kagyu 
teachings from India. 



88 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

Yet my guru never postured nor put on the air of high realization, like those 
meditators who never lower their vacant, glaring gaze to the ground and who 
spout random •profound• statements such as •Everything in samsara and nirvana 
are equal!• What do you gain from such pretense? 

Samten Gyatso would move about as if he were just an ordinary person. He kept 
to the hidden yogi style: he didn't flaunt his accomplishments and never behaved 
as if he were a grand lama. He would not bless people by placing his hand on their 
heads nor sit on a high seat. He didn't even let people bow to him-if anyone tried, 
he would jump up and move away. He avoided ostentatious displays like erect· 
ing impressive temples or commissioning fancy statues. He kept a low profile: he 
never dressed up or wore brocade, but just the robes of an ordinary monk. 

If Sam ten Gyatso had any special understanding or powers, he was careful not 
to show them. Moreover, he would not tolerate anyone speaking to him about 
his good qualities-he wouldn't even give them an opening. For instance, if they 
started to say, •Rinpoche, you are very learned• or ·You must be very realized; he 
would immediately scold them. He would never talk about himself as being spe· 
cial, not a single word. No one ever heard him say, •I have realized• such-and-such 
or •I have these special qualities:' Not once! 

Sam ten Gyatso's daily practice consisted of the Heart Essence ofSamantabhadra 
and the Heart Essence ofChetsun. You could say that these two teachings were his 
innermost personal practice. As he put it, ·To meet with a practice like this just 
once guarantees you an end to samsara:' 

He also had a deep fondness for the masters Longchenpa and Jigmey Lingpa. 
He would often read aloud from Longchenpa's Seven Treasuries, not as a formal 
reading transmission but just for himself-slowly and in a gentle tone of voice. He 
always carried one of these seven volumes with him wherever he went, so that by 
the end of the year he would complete his reading of aU seven. After some years, 
he knew exactly where to find every single detail mentioned anywhere in these 
Treasuries. He would sometimes comment, •How wonderful! What an amazing 
master Longchenpa must have been! How profound his words are!· 

The Lotus Essence Tantra was a text my uncle Samten Gyatso considered of 
utmost importance. He transmitted it to people again and again and often taught 
it. This is probably why one of the first things I did when I came to Nepal was to 
have the blocks carved. Sometimes my uncle would prepare blessed substances 
by reciting this tantra along with two other tantras that give liberation through 
hearing, touching or tasting. One is the famous Single Child of the Buddhas and 



My Guru, Samtcn Gyatso 

the other is known as the Universal Panacea. He would then ask people to put 
the substance into a large river to benefit all the beings who lived there and in the 
great ocean. Chokgyur Lingpa revealed several such tantras. 

Samten Gyatso once told me, •1 have two texts that can truly benefit others. 
One is the Single Child of the Buddhas and the other is the Lotus Essence Tantra. 
And there is absolutely no doubt about that!• 

It was rare for him to make such a claim. 

In terms of his tulku lineage, Samten Gyatso was the fourth incarnation of 
the highly accomplished master Ngawang Trinley of the Tsangsar clan.•s At the 

age of five he was taken to Lachab monastery, where he stayed with my previous 
incarnation, Chowang Tulku, who became his root guru. Samten Gyatso was 
then installed as the lord of Dharma of that monastery. In his youth, he stayed at 
Lachab and at Fortress Peak, while later he lived in one cave and hermitage after 
another. 

Samten Gyatso received ordination as a monk from Karmey Khenpo. He 
may also have received the pointing-out instruction as well as the confirmation 
of insight from Karmey Khenpo, which might be why he had extraordinary 
faith in him- just like my father's trust in his root guru, Sontar ChOnchok, 
and Uncle Tersey's devotion for his, Shakya Shri. Later on, Tsewang Norbu 
became Samten Gyatso's main guru, fol-

lowed by many other great masters living 
in Kham.16 

My uncle Sang-Ngak and, strangely 
enough, his own mother, Konchok Paldron, 
both regarded Sam ten Gyatso as their root 
guru. My father too had profound faith in 
Samten Gyatso and every time we went to 
Fortress Peak, even before we came within 
sight of the hermitage, he would dismount 
and bow down twenty or thirty times. 

I heard a wonderful story about one 
of Samten Gyatso's prior incarnations, 
Ngaktrin of Argong. He was recognized as 
a tulku while still a small child and brought

to Lachab, his predecessor's monastery. One day, when he was just eight, he was 
having fun with his friends, as children do. An old gonia-the lama in charge of 
the chants for the protectors-was beating a drum and chanting while the kids 
were playing boisterously around him. 

•you are an incarnation of a lama,· the gonia suddenly berated the young 
Ngaktrin. •oon't behave like this. A tulku should be a noble boy, but you are a 
spoiled brat! Why are you doing this? What's the use? Listen: don't wander! Don't 
wander!· 

•What does that mean?" the little tulku asked •What does it mean not to wander?" 
·oon't let your mind wander,· replied the old lama. •That's what it means!· 
·How does one not wander?" 
·Look at yourself. Look at your own mind!• 
When the boy heard these words-·oon't wander; look at your own mind!• -he 

recognized mind nature right then and there. Despite all the great masters he met 
later in his life, he always said his insight occurred when he was a young child 

Later on, Ngaktrin went to Palpung monastery in Derge, where he went into 
the traditional three-year retreat. When he went through that retreat for a second 
time, he was installed as the retreat master. There he reached an incredibly high 
level of practice. 

As it happened, the great master Situ Perna Nyinje was the head of the monas-
tery. In the latter part of his life, Situ's eyebrows covered the upper part of his eyes, 
blocking his vision. When he had to read something, he needed to put his fingers 
to his eyebrows and lift them in order to see. Apart from this, his eyes were always 
covered or closed. 

Only in the autumn would Situ open his eyes and look out the window, mainly 
to gaze at a rhododendron on the hill opposite Palpung, which blossomed then. 
•Ah! The rhododendron is in full bloom; he would exclaim. But as he got older, his 
eyes couldn't open at all. 

One day, Chokgyur Lingpa came to Palpung for the first time. Someone an-
nounced to Situ, •A fellow who calls himself Chokgyur Lingpa is coming. He's that 
Kyasu terton from Nangchen we've been hearing about:'17 

Situ didn't believe in just any terton who happened to pass by. Indeed, Situ had 
been decidedly unimpressed by another recently visiting terton, about whom he 
had remarked, ·well, well! That guy claims to be a treasure revealer, but his pos-
turing seems to me merely an excuse to keep a woman. All he really succeeds in 
doing is defaming the Lotus-Born master:' 



My Guru, Sam ten Gyatso 91 

·. But Situ had some confidence in Chokgyur Lingpa, and so was prepared to 
meet him. Nonetheless, he called for Lama Ngaktrin, saying to him, •1 hear that 
you have clear dreams due to your practice of Naropa's Six Doctrines. This Kyasu 
TertOn claims to be an emissary of Padmasambhava and has declared himself a 
major revealer of treasures. But I don't trust just anyone who claims to be a terton. 
Since our monastery has arranged to welcome him as a dignitary tomorrow, you 
should '!3tch your dreams tonight for signs that might verify his claims. Report 
back to me any experiences or visions you have:" 

Ngaktrin was quite a remarkable practitioner and had accomplished much in 
his retreat. During his dreams that night, he received a prophecy confirming that 
Chokgyur Lingpa was indeed an authentic terton. Upon hearing this dream, Situ 
was delighted and amused. 

"Ha ha! Ha ha!• he joked, •Chokgyur Lingpa must be a true terton-assuming 
of course that we can trust your dreams:" 

When Chokgyur Lingpa arrived, he told Situ: •you are one of Padmasambhava's 
emissaries. The Lotus-Born master personally commanded me to give you a teach-
ing called Dagger of the Sevenfold Profundity to protect against obstacles to your 
longevity:" 

"Is that so?" Situ replied. ·rm too old to do the recitations myself. While you 
do them, I will watch for the signs:" Traditionally, on completion of a retreat, one 
looks for signs of blessings and success in practice. 

Situ then put the terton in strict retreat for a month to practice the Dagger of 
the Sevenfold Profundity. At the end of the month, Situ's servants prepared to fetch 
for him the blessed articles from Chokgyur Lingpa. 

"No, the terton has to come in person to give me the empowerment: Situ in-
sisted. •It won't help me just to have the terton send up shrine objects-the secret 
Vajrayana is not something you simply put on someone's head. Call for the terton 
himselfl. 

So after he finished his retreat, this unknown terton offered the empowerment 
for the Dagger of the Sevenfold Profundity to Situ, the most revered Karma Kagyu 
lama east of Lhasa. 

Here's another story I heard about Lama Ngaktrin, Samten Gyatso's previous 
birth. 



92 SPIRITUAL RooTs 

The winters in eastern Tibet were so cold that the water from the snow melt-
ing under the sun's rays would freeze in its flow, creating broad barriers of icicles, 
some up to three stories high. These would sometimes block the steep mountain 
trails, making travel impossible. Yet no matter how cold it was or how much snow 
had fallen, there was never any snow on Lama Ngaktrin's roof: it would melt from 
his tummo, the yogic practice of inner heat. 

One day, Ngaktrin received news that one of his major sponsors had passed 
away on the other side of the mountain pass. On the way there, a river had flooded 
and then frozen, so that huge ice curtains rose to a height of two or three stories. 
There was no way to get through. 

A request arrived via a much longer trail for Lama Ngaktrin to come and do 
phowa, the ejection of consciousness, for the dead patron. Ngaktrin, without a 
moment's hesitation, replied, ·rm coming!·" 

His attendants tried to dissuade him, protesting, •How can you go? Do you 
want to die in the icy water? And if you have to travel around the ice curtains, it 
will take you two or three days. How can you, an old lama, go there? There's no 
way-just forget about it:" 

But Ngaktrin said: •No, it would be very improper not to go. He has been a kind 
patron to me. If I fail to reach him, it would be a serious breach of samaya. I'm go-
ing tomorrow morning, no matter what!• 

The servants could do nothing but obey, although unhappy that they would 
have to take the long treacherous way around. Ngaktrin however assured them 
that that wouldn't be necessary. 

Bright and early the next morning, he told his attendants, •Last night I cleared 
the way:" 

Sure enough, all the ice on the whole mountain pass had melted. There was not 
a flake of snow anywhere; they could travel freely. When asked, ·How can this be 
possible?· Ngaktrin simply responded, ·Last night I practiced a little tummo and 
melted it:" 

Though he had been installed as the head of Lachab monastery, Sam ten Gyatso 
longed for the lifestyle of•a yogi of true simplicity:" So one day he gave up respon-
sibility for the monastery's upkeep, as well as all of his official duties and went to 
live in a cave. 

His only wish was to meditate while leading the simple life of a renunciate, 
without any of the pomp and circumstance that surrounds an important lama nor 
the obligations of being at the disposal of benefactors. Since he was the main tulku 



My Guru, Samten Gyatso 

of the monastery, no one felt they could object to his wishes; they had to let him 
do what he wanted. He would have been quite content to continue living like this, 
but it was not to be. 

Eventually, Samten Gyatso journeyed to Tsikey monastery in order to study 
with Karmey Khenpo. As he grew older, Samten Gyatso became an invaluable 
upholder and advocate of Chokgyur Lingpa's termas. Of the four brothers-all 
tulkus-=it was he who rendered the greatest service to the New Treasures, even 
more so than the terton's two direct reincarnations. 

Here is how this vital Dharma activity unfolded. Being a direct descendant of 
the terton himself, Sam ten Gyatso felt a deep appreciation for the New Treasures, 
and so he began a dedicated search for any of these texts he could find. In fact, 
this was the only project besides meditation that he put any effort into as a young 
man. 

Even while living the life of a yogi in various caves, he always had four or five 
private scribes nearby whose task was to copy out all forty of the volumes. He 
would then proofread these handwritten texts to ensure their complete accuracy. 
I saw them-they were astounding!" 

Samten Gyatso's tenacious search for the full collection of the New Treasures 
also ensured that he received all their empowerments, reading transmissions and 
instructions. The majority of these he received from the terton's son Tsewang 
Norbu-like one precious vase filled to the brim from another-but he also re-
ceived every one of these teachings that Karmey Khenpo had. 

Samten Gyatso's main interest-his innermost passion, you might say-was 
Dharma scriptures. He ardently collected each and every one that he considered 
of importance, not only the New Treasures. His library, very large by Nangchen 
standards, grew so big it would have filled the shrine hall at my current hermitage, 
Nagi Gompa. Even one hundred fully loaded yaks wouldn't have been enough to 
move his collection. 

His willingness to undertake any necessary trouble in this pursuit of rare 
texts was famous; he sought them out wherever he could. If he was invited into 
someone's home for a ceremony, before he began he would scan every cloth-
wrapped scripture kept on their shrine. He would take the time to explore their 
entire library, even if there were two hundred volumes. He would insist that 
each book be unwrapped from its cloth cover so he could inspect every single 
one of what often proved to be many texts within. He didn't care if this took an 
entire day. 

93 



94 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

Not only was my teacher extremely fond of books; they also had to be copied 
beautifully and precisely. Otherwise he would return the book to its scribe, saying, 
•you can keep this one-I don't need it. I only want true quality~ 

And he wasn't merely committed to collecting Dharma books. He also had a 
vast collection of the finest implements for rituals. Whatever was missing for a 
given ceremony he would commission an artisan to make, always to the highest 
standards. 

If it weren't for the destruction wreaked by the communist invasion, these fine 
manuscripts and ritual implements would still exist today-but all of them have 
been lost. 

Shortly before Sam ten Gyatso died, I spent many evenings with him. He would 
lie in his bed and I would sleep on the floor beside him. One night, as we were 
talking, Samten Gyatso began to speak, for the first time, about his innermost 
realization. 

•I never had special experiences; he told me, ~ut as the years passed by, my 
trust in the authenticity of the Dharma has grown. I am now confident in the truth 
of the three kayas. At the age of eight, I recognized the nature of mind and since 
then I have never forsaken it. Of course my diligence varied and I got distracted at 
times, but mostly I kept to the practice of mind's natural state~ 

I heard him say this only once. Other than this, he never discussed such per-
sonal matters. 

That same evening he also told me about his relationships with Khakyab Dorje 
and Tsewang Norbu, as well as with his other teachers. Here is one of those stories. 

While Tsewang Norbu was giving the empowerments for the Treasury oj 
Precious Termas at Riwoche monastery, all the major lamas and khenpos would 
gather in the evenings for supper and conversation. Usually this informal gather-
ing took place in Tsewang Norbu's private room, which was otherwise the cham-
ber of the head lama. The room would be packed each night and people would 
request all kinds of instructions, clearing up any doubts and uncertainties they 
might have had in their meditation practice. 

One evening the three grand lamas of Riwoche were all there, as were both the 
Neten and Tsikey incarnations of Chokgyur Lingpa, as well as my youngest uncle, 
Tersey. Samten Gyatso was still quite young at the time and, among all these im-
portant masters and khenpo-teachers, kept a low profile, sitting dose to the door. 



My Guru, Samtell Gyatso 95 

He was dressed in ordinary, low-quality monk's robes, not in a brocade vest like 
some of the lamas. 

One night, Tscwang Norbu scanned the room with his large eyes wide open, 
then pointed directly at Sam ten Gyatso aU the way at the back of the room and 
boomed in his famously brazen manner, "By the Three Jewels! You see that hum-
ble monk sitting by the door? Lamas, take note, his name is Samten Gyatso! 
As y6u may welJ know, he is the son of Chokgyur Lingpa's daughter Konchok 
Paldron:" 

He looked around the room, staring intensely at each person. Everyone stopped 
in their tracks. 

"Right now you think highly of yourselves,• Tsewang Norbu continued in his 
loud voice. "You there, you think you are one of Chokgyur Lingpa's incarnations 
and you over there think you're one too. And you; he was pointing at Uncle Tersey, 
"you consider yourself the tulku ofWangchok Dorje-don't you?!? Sam ten Gyatso 
back there by the door, he is not proud at all-but when it comes to continuing 
the lineage of the New Treasures, I swear by the Three Jewels, he will surpass all of 
you! Through him these Treasures will spread far and wide, like the renown of the 
Jowo statue in Lhasa. That humble monk wilJ be the pillar upholding the teachings 
ofChokgyur Lingpa!·90 

Remember, these were not unimportant lamas gathered around him; they were 
all tulkus and khenpos of high stature. The room went silent as they looked around 
at one another. Then they turned to look behind them at the little monk in ordi-
naryrobes. 

For his part, Samten Gyatso felt ilJ at ease. He thought to himself, "Why does 
this great yogi have to say such things, even swearing, in front of great lamas?• 
· Although Tsewang Norbu was his uncle, even Samten Gyatso was a little afraid 
of him. And when he made a statement like this, it sounded like a prophecy-one 
Samten Gyatso never forgot. 

After completing alJ the empowerments, Tsewang Norbu stopped at our 
Tsangsar family home on his way to Central Tibet. During his stay, he asked to 
camp in a big white tent, which was erected outside the nearby temple hall. One 
day, he sent for Sam ten Gyatso, who lived a day's horse ride away. In those days, 
Samten Gyatso was content to live the life of a simple yogi-monk. 

"I received word that Tsewang Norbu has requested my presence; Samten 
Gyatso recalled. "On arriving I was led to his tent. When I entered the tent, 1 saw 
a large throne with some of his robes lying on it:" 



96 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

·we are going to have an enthronement-right now, in this very tent!" Tsewang 
Norbu announced "You are going to take the position of a triple-vow vajra 
holder-do you hear me? And from now on, you are never to give up Chokgyur 
Lingpa's teachings!" 

Then he forced Samten Gyatso to sit on the throne. While my guru sat there, 
Tsewang Norbu gave him one gift after another, beginning with his personal vajra 
and bell, as well as a full set of his own robes. 

"From today on, I empower you to be a vajra master; Tscwang Norbu con-
tinued. ·And now, by giving you a complete set of my robes, I appoint you as my 
representative. I entrust you with the lineage of the New Treasures. You must carry 
out the work of continuing Chokgyur Lingpa's teachings:' 

Though Samten Gyatso protested, he was still enthroned as a vajra master and 
invested with this weighty responsibility. 

At the end of the ceremony, Tsewang Norbu said, "Nephew, tonight you and 1 
will stay in this tent-we have lots to talk about;" 

That evening he told Samten Gyatso, "We won't meet again in these bodies. I 
place all my possessions in your hands;" 

Then he gave Samten Gyatso everything he owned-his clothing, brocade gar-
ments, ritual implements and all the rest. 

"I say we won't see each other face-to-face again in this life, but even if we did, 
it wouldn't make any difference. AU this is yours now:" 

The next morning, Tsewang Norbu set off on his journey and Samten Gyatso 
never saw him again.'' 

After several years passed, Samten Gyatso received a letter from the Karmapa, 
Khakyab Dorje, asking him to travel to Tsurphu to give the empowerments for the 
New Treasures. After reading the letter, his only comment was, "There is nothing 
in terms of view, meditation, and conduct that I could possibly improve upon for 
Khakyab Dorje. But if this is his wish, then I will give him the transmission as if it 
were a mandala offering;" 

This was the other reason why Samten Gyatso accompanied Konchok Paldron 
on the journey to Central Tibet. 

Upon arriving in Central Tibet, Samten Gyatso went straight to the Karinapa's 
seat at Tsurphu. These are the first words Khakyab Dorje spoke to him: 

•I tried to have Tsewang Norbu bestow the transmission of the New Treasures, 
since he was not only Chokgyur Lingpa's son but also an authentic vajra master 
endowed with the three levels of precepts.ts I requested it from him because he 



My Guru, Samten Gyatso 

was incomparable, possessing all the true characteristics of a master. Yet it appears 
he didn't see things as I did; otherwise how could he refuse me? I also made the 
same request of your brother, Tersey Tulku, who likewise refused. Now, Sam ten 
Gyatso, since you are the son of Chokgyur Lingpa's daughter and also in the divine 
bloodline of Tsangsar, you must confer the empowerments upon me:' 

This was the Karmapa's command. 
Samten Gyatso stood up and bowed three times. ·You are Avalokiteshvara in 

person. Honestly, I'm not qualified to bestow empowerments on such an exalted 
lama as you. To be a Vajrayana guru, one must possess the tenfold characteristics. 
Forget about aU ten, I don't possess even a single one of them! If I had a choice 
between giving and not giving empowerments, I would rather not. That much is 
certain. On the other hand, I would never do anything to upset you:' 

"Whether you have all ten attributes, only one or none at all, you still have to 
give me this transmission:' Since this was the Karmapa's order, Sam ten Gyatso had 
no choice but to concede. 

"I guess I must; my guru said. ·chokgyur Lingpa's termas are like refined gold 
and as soon as this pure gold is in your hands, Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, it will defi-
nitely benefit both the Dharma and sentient beings:' 

He then proceeded to give the complete transmission of the New Treasures 
to the Karmapa. The lineage of this transmission went from Chokgyur Lingpa to 
Tsewang Norbu to Samten Gyatso, and this is how he passed it on to the fifteenth 
Karmapa. 

Samten Gyatso received many teachings from the Karmapa as well-that's why 
Samten Gyatso regarded the Karmapa as one of his own teachers. My guru would 
tell me how the Karmapa was an inconceivably great master, about his clairvoyant 
powers and accomplishment, and how he could perceive the three times as clearly 
as something placed in the palm of his hand. Samten Gyatso's trust in Khakyab 
Dorje was so deep that merely mentioning this Karmapa's name would bring tears 
tO his eyes. 

Some time after Samten Gyatso arrived at Tsurphu, he was invited to the 
Karmapa's private chambers. As my guru walked in, he saw a throne set out, be-
decked with brocade robes, crown and all the paraphernalia of a vajra master. Just 
as with Tsewang Norbu, the Karmapa told him to sit down on the throne. And 
again, at first there was much protesting back and forth. 

"I command you to sit there; Khakyab Dorje finally said. •1 am enthroning you 
as a vajra master. If you don't uphold the Dharma, then who will? On the outer 

97

level of the ethical precepts, you have not impaired them so much as a mustard 
seed's worth. On the inner level of a bodhisattva and on the innermost tantric level 
of a vidyadhara, there is no one who can match your realization of the view of the 
heart essence of the Great Perfection. You are truly a vajra holder of the threefold 
precepts~ 

The Karmapa continued, •It seems to be your wish to live as a simple renunci-
ate in remote mountain dwellings and caves. You have done so until now-and 
isn't it true that you still prefer to do so? But now I tell you this: From this very da)· 
onward, you must renounce that idea! 

·Today I enthrone you as a vajra master who guides sentient beings, as one 
who confers the ripening empowerments and who gives the liberating instruc· 
tions with the supportive reading transmissions. I demand that you pledge to do 
so right here in front of me! From now on, this is your task;" 

He added, •Now it will be absolutely inappropriate for you to follow the ex-
ample of the Kagyu forefathers by giving up everything. I want to hear you vow to 
give up such ways! I know full well that your intention has been to retreat to some 
secluded hermitage once you leave Central Tibet and return to Kham-but if you 
do so, you will be going directly against my command!• 

Samten Gyatso stood up and went to the throne. But before sitting down, he 
made one last protest. •1 do this with hesitation. I have lived in caves and wanted 
nothing more. I yearned to devote myself solely to meditation and I wish you 
wouldn't force me to do this~ 

·usten here!• the Karmapa replied emphatically. ·oo not sever our samaya link. 
Now sit down!• 

This left Sam ten Gyatso quite cheerless. He would never say that the Karmapa 
had created an obstacle for his practice-but if he hadn't been given this direct 
command, you wouldn't have found him anywhere but in remote mountain re· 
treats. There is no way he would have retaken charge of Lachab monastery. 

Sam ten Gyatso often told me, •I had no wish whatsoever to be the head of a 
monastery. All I wanted was to stay isolated high above the tree line:' 

Before Samten Gyatso became enthroned as vajra master, he had very rarely 
placed his hand on someone's head in the gesture of bestowing blessings. If it ever 
did happen for some reason, the people of that area were overjoyed, telling each 
other, ·How lucky I am! I received Samten Gyatso's blessing!• In the past, no one 
had received an empowerment or reading transmission from him either, let alone 
a blessing on their head. 

•From that point on; he told me, •I really fell under the power of Mara; the 
demon of obstacles, •and began to give empowerments and teachings. That was 



My Guru, Samten Gyatso 

when I fell down to my present low level. One distraction followed another, as 
now 1 had to perform rituals in a steady stream. But this was never my plan; I 
never aimed to live in splendor and admiration-only like a deer in the moun-
tains~ 

Samten Gyatso was definitely the most self-assured of the four brothers and 
his confidence grew stronger as he aged. Because of his dignity and his dominat-
ing presence, people found it hard to approach him for small talk. In fact, I never 
saw him chat with anyone. His eyes burned with an astounding brilliance, like the 
flame of a butter lamp flaring up at its end-somewhat like the bright eyes of a 
kitten. Coming into his presence, you felt him penetrating your innermost core, 
la)ing bare your deepest secrets. 

Everyone was afraid of him. It wasn't the way he dressed, for he wore the simple 
robes of a monk, yet even lamas were completely intimidated by him. Most lamas 
and monks would try to get out of his way if they saw him in the distance coming 
toward them. Whenever he entered a room people made way for him-even lofty 
dignitaries. It didn't matter who they were; everyone was completely terrified and 
would scramble to clear a path for him. Even my father would assume the role of 
servant the moment he was in Sam ten Gyatso's presence. 

It was amusing to see how daunting that bald little old monk in ordinary robes 
could be. He even intimidated the sixteenth Karmapa, who, when he was already 
twenty, told me, •Now, take Samten Gyatso. There, finally, is someone I'm in awe 
of. I don't know why, but that old lama scares me! I even think twice about asking 
to be excused to go to the toilet!· 

It was true for me, too. Every morning when I stood before the door to his 
quarters, I would hesitate before daring to open the door. 

He possessed some remarkable quality, an intensely commanding presence. 
There was nothing really to be afraid of, but we were all definitely scared of him. 

After Karmey Khenpo died, he was reborn as my cousin. We simply called him 
Khentrul, meaning the incarnation of Karmey Khenpo. The young Khentrul was 
quite courageous and remarkably eloquent. Once he said to me, ·why should 
we be scared of Samten Gyatso? He's just our uncle:'" But whenever Khentrul 
came into Samten Gyatso's presence and saw his bald head, he would forget 
what he had been about to say. He would lower his gaze and start to tremble 
very slightly. 

99

Khentrul explained, •Every time I go to meet Samten Gyatso-who after all 
is my own uncle-I try to remind myself that he is a human being just like 
me. Even though he is a very noble monk, there is absolutely no reason to feel 
intimidated. But the moment I'm in his presence, I find myself hesitant and 
trembling. 

•1 try to reason with myself: what are people so scared of? When I look at him. 
I see an elderly man wearing simple clothes. Maybe it's his bald head, I don't know, 
or maybe it's his eyes. They are kind of unusual and hard to look into. It's as if they 
see what's deep inside you. So I remind myself I don't have to be afraid; after all 
he's my uncle. But none of that works!" 

There's a saying, ·True confidence overwhelms others." It's hard to put a finger 
on exactly what that quality might be-but you often see it in people who have 
profound meditative realization. 

No matter where he was, Samten Gyatso had a certain influence on people. 
There was no small talk; he didn't leave any room for superficial conversation, just 
sincere questions about practice, for which he never lacked an answer. When he 
gave instructions, Samten Gyatso would foresee how his words would end up-
whether they would be put to good use or not. 

To laypeople, whose main aim was mundane success and raising families, he 
would give the mantra of Avalokiteshvara-OM MAN I PEME HUNG-and teachings 
on trust and devotion. But he gave special attention to people who had dedicated 
their lives to deepening their experience and realization. With a sincere practitio-
ner he would truly share his heart. 

In either case, whenever someone left an interview with him, they were deeply 
inspired and full of admiration. 

Many old ngakpas lived around Lachab monastery and whenever they heard 
that Sam ten Gyatso had come home, they would immediately flock to his room to 
receive teachings on the Dzogchen view. Sometimes they stayed throughout the 
night, not leaving until morning. These meditators, his closest disciples, marveled 
at the clarity of his teachings-and such seasoned meditators were very hard to 
impress. 

These old ngakpas loved Samten Gyatso and felt that his mind was completely 
unimpeded. In fact, anyone who had a chance to discuss their meditation practice 
with him always came out amazed-no matter who, no matter how learned. 

In any discussion Samten Gyatso had with knowledgeable scholars who had 
oceans of learning behind them, as the hours passed they all became humbled on 



My Guru, Sam ten Gyatso 101 

the topic of meditation experience. Finally, their initial air of self-assurance would 
dissipate altogether and they couldn't help requesting teachings from him, asking 
one question after another. 

As Samten Gyatso imparted the essential meditation practice, his majestic 
presence would shine through ever stronger, intimidating even the most learned 
khenpo. The more anyone talked with Samten Gyatso, the more clearly they dis-
covered how invincible his self-confidence was. This unshakable assurance signi-
fies profound practice and personal experience. 

That's the kind of guru I had. 

There were many other lamas and meditators who had deep devotion and trust 

in Sam ten Gyatso. 
One day, a meditator who lived above Tsangsar came out of Sam ten Gyatso's 

room as I went in. 
·roday I had the chance to help someone, just a tiny little bit,• my guru re-

marked. •This guy is a first-class practitioner, truly industrious. But he believes he 
has been cultivating emptiness, while in fact he trains in imprisoning the awak-
ened state. What's the use of keeping it locked up? 

1 succeeded in making it clear to him that emptiness isn't anything you can 
possibly cultivate. How can you construct emptiness? After we talked, this medi-
tator understood and was able to gain a little trust.• 

Later, I ran into this meditator, who told me, •1n my life I have met many teach-
ers and received numerous instructions. But if I hadn't met Samten Gyatso, I'm 
not sure I would have progressed along the true path. On that day he settled some-
thing in my mind with utmost clarity. Now I don't even have as much as a hair-tip 
of doubt.• 

This man had incredible devotion to Samten Gyatso. It was obvious to me that 
he had more than •a little trust.• 

Once at his monastery, my father arranged for a drubchen and asked Samten 
Gyatso to preside." During the long hours of the drubchen, they and my two other 
uncles sat together. 

•Something strange happened during this time; my father recalled. •I saw a 
shimmer of rainbow light surrounding Sam ten Gyatso. The next day, it happened 
again while he was sitting on his throne. On the third day, the colored light was so 
intense that I couldn't see his physical body.

"All three of us- his brothers- saw it, and we discussed 
what the reason might be. One of us had simple pure per-
ception of the rainbow light. Another was unhappy, fearing 
it might be an ominous sign that he was nearing death. 

"But none of us had the guts to mention it directly to 
Samten Gyatso. If we had done so, there is no doubt we 
would have been scolded. 'Why do you bring up such non· 
sense?' he would have said. 

"But that doesn't change the fact that all three of us saw 
his body as though it were made of rainbow light~ 

Samten Gyatso passed away later that same year.

My Father, 
the Performer of Miracles 

When my father was very young, he was recognized as a tulku, the fourth incarna-
tion of the master Sonam Yeshe of Tsangsar. One day, some lamas rode up to the 
Tsangsar family home; they were from the monastery where, in his previous in-
carnation, my father had been head lama. They demanded to see my grandmother 
and then asked her to hand the child over to them. 

Their arrival happened to coincide with the passing away of my great-grand-
mother, Lady Degah. 9S 

"This is a time of mourning~ she told the monks. •My mother has just passed 
away and I'm very busy with her funeral arrangements. Please don't ask me about 
my son right now. I probably will have to hand him over to you-how can I ignore 
the Karmapa and his regents' command?-but this is not the time for me to ac-
cept a white scarf and to celebrate the tulku's return. Come back when the funeral 
ceremonies are complete. In the meantime, the tulku stays with me~ 

The emissary was very pushy and-let's not shy away from the word-insensi-
tive. 

"Heh, heh; he laughed condescendingly. ·we are discussing a vajra command: 
there is only one thing for you to say and that is 'yes: I will not accept any other 
answer from you. I cannot and I will not return to the monastery empty-handed; 
he added emphatically. 

The lama's monastery was a two-day horse ride from the Tsangsar family estate. 
"This matter must be settled today; he continued. •I have come too far to return 
\\ithout the tulku. I won't accept any postponement~ 
· "Dear lama; Grandmother cautioned, •don't be so brazen. I already told you I 

would give you my son-but this day is not right for an auspicious beginning. My 
mother's body is still lying there; only three days have gone by since her death.· 

She continued in a reasonable tone, ·According to normal social conventions, 
people don't speak so rudely as you to someone they respect. You don't have to 



104 SPIRITUAL RooTs 

act like this. And remember, a mother always has the final say in the well-being of 
her own child.'" 

•That doesn't make the slightest difference: the lama retorted. 
My grandmother warned, ·There's no need to talk like that! I'm only asking you 

to wait one week. Don't be so aggressive!· 
But the lama persisted, saying he didn't have a week to wait. •1 can't agree with 

you: he insisted. •This must be settled right now:' 
Grandmother was the kind of person who stuck to her word. She wouldn't 

budge. 
•1 told you no! I'm not going to hand my son over to you and I'm certainly not 

going to your monastery for a celebration. And one more thing: I am not afraid of 
you, nor should I be. You may be somebody important where you are from, but 
here I am somebody important. Why should I defer to you? You will gain nothing 
by being so aggressive!· 

By then, the lama had already placed the white scarf before grandmother and 
she now handed it back to him. So he tossed it over to her again-and again she 
threw it back. The scarf went back and forth three times. 

The lama made one more attempt to wrap the scarf around Grandmother's 
neck, as is the custom. She resisted, saying, ·No one dresses up in their finest when 
their mother has passed away! Or maybe you want to strangle me!• 

They got into quite a quarrel and it turned a bit nasty. Finally, Grandmother ex-
claimed, •Now I'm absolutely certain: I won't accept your white scarfl1 shall never 
hand my son over to someone like you! As he is my child, he is in my care! You will 
never get him-so you might as well get out!• 

The lama responded with spite, ·well, if that's the case, then we definitely don't 
want this tulku at all!• 

Now there was no way to heal the rift and on that note, the lama marched away 
like an adversary leaving his enemy's camp. 

But he didn't go far; the lama and his cohorts pitched camp in a juniper grove 
nearby. From that vantage point they kept an eye on our house. 

It was very clear what they were up to. Chimey Dorje was kept inside and wasn't 
allowed to walk around outside unattended-otherwise they would have snatched 
him up and ridden off back to their monastery. 1 heard that three or four monks 
stayed in their little camp for several weeks, playing this waiting game. Finally, 
they all left. 

I still have a hard time appreciating their brand of•devotion:" 



My Father, the Performer of Miracles 105 

Not long after the funeral, Grandmother had to travel to Tsikey. As her party 
came out of a narrow pass, they suddenly confronted twenty-five monks on horse-
back. The monks blocked the trail; except for the absence of rifles, it was like fac-
ing a division of an opposing army ready for battle. They demanded Grandmother 
hand her son over to them right then and there. 

Chimey Dorje, was only three, but he was clever. When the monks were about 
to grab him,·he objected, "I'm not Sonam Yeshe's tulku. It's him!• and he pointed 
at his brother, my uncle Sang-Ngak, who was standing next to him. 

Unfortunately, one of the monks in the "welcoming party• knew better and 
retorted, "It's not true. That's his brother.· 

During this confrontation, Grandmother's attendants had their hands on their 
knives. ·we can at least kill a few of them,· they whispered to her. "What do you 
\\-ant us to do?• 

"No, today there is no need to shed blood; my grandmother cautioned. "Anyway, 
there are twenty-five of them; you would be lucky to overcome eight or ten. They 
have the upper hand, so they win this round. Rainbows don't appear every day-
let's be patient. Our day will come7 

You can see how obstinate some I<hampas can be: Konchok Paldron's small child 
was being abducted in front of her very eyes and there was nothing she could do. 

In the meantime, a monk had grabbed Chimey Dorje, wrapping him up tightly 
in his shawl and the maroon-dad gang of monks carried him off. 

As soon as the locals around the Tsangsar family estate heard about the ab-
duction, they prepared for battle and marched toward the monastery where my 
father had been taken. Fighting was just about to break out when the local piinpo 
chieftain intervened. 

He prohibited them from fighting and instead offered to mediate the dispute. 
His proposal was that my grandparents would agree to give up their son and in re-
turn the monastery would offer an apology, with lavish gifts to appease my grand-
mother. 

Her husband-my grandfather, Orgyen Chopel-was a very influential person 
in the area and as a gentleman he was not interested in carrying on a dispute. His 
view was, "Of course we should give them the tulku. 1 don't blame the old lama for 
being assertive nor do I blame the child's mother for what she told him. The lama 
\IdS at fault-but now he is happy to reconcile and see the case settled.· 

And so my grandfather accepted the settlement and my father remained in the 
monastery's care. 



106 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

This was how my father was ·invited· to his monastery as a reincarnated lama. 

My grandmother was far from happy about this turn of events, and decided to 
leave her husband and his family estate. 

•There is no way in the world I will remain here any longer~ she proclaimed "I 
will go and live near Tsikey Chokling:' So she moved to the seat of her father and 
brothers." 

Meanwhile, my father's education began immediately, and at that early age he 
was forced to sit the entire day learning to read and write. He progressed in his 
studies and his monastery flourished After two years, Chimey Dorje's reading 
skills were so impressive that word traveled around the countryside. 

After five years had passed, he insisted on seeing his mother. 
By now the manager at my father's monastery felt confident that since my fa. 

ther was eight it would be safe to escort him to see his mother for a short visit and 
then bring him back. Everyone at his monastery thought that the disagreement 
had been settled long ago, and now everything was just fine and dandy. So they 
allowed him to go see his mother at Tsikey, escorted by ten monks. 

But after five or six days, Konchok Paldron told them, ·The ten of you can re· 
turn now-but without my son:' 

And she kept Chimey Dorje there. 

The ten monks were headed by a very nice lama, who put up no resistance. 
But they were heavy of heart as they rode back to their monastery without their 
tulku. 

·When we reached the main gate~ that same lama later told my father, •I yelled 
out, 'They kept our tulku!' And just then that brazen old lama who had started the 
whole affair fell out a window. 

•It was all very inauspicious. Like a storm brewing, word spread quickly. All 
the monks and lamas gathered in the main hall, and the courtyard filled with local 
people. Everyone became quite agitated and incensed; tears fell and harsh words 
were spoken:' 

Messengers were sent back and forth to Tsikey. My father's monastery was re-
lentless, but my grandmother remained adamant. 

·we cannot possibly fight Tsikey Gompa~ the lamas decided. ·But we will defi-
nitely take this case to the highest authority:' So my father's monastery brought a 
legal case against Tsikey and things began to get ugly. 



My Father, the Performer of Miracles 107 

As my father's monastery was Kagyu, they referred the case all the way up to 
Palpung, which was the major Kagyu seat in Derge. The monastery sent a repre-
sentative to plead their case. Undaunted, the Chokling of Tsikey personalJy went 
to Palpung, pleading Grandmother's case with his well-known eloquence and in-
genuity. 

The head of Palpung was an incarnation of the great Situ Rinpoche, who was 
quite young at the time and very mild-mannered; he begged them not to fight. 
Tsikey Chokling and his entourage stayed in one room, and representatives of 
the plaintiff stayed in another. It was quite an elaborate dispute with many lamas 
involved and lasted about fifteen days. 

In short, the plaintiffs argued that the Karmapa had recognized their tulku and 
according to tradition there was no doubt that the tulku should return to his mon-
astery, where he rightfully belonged. Otherwise it would be like casting to the 
~ind a letter bearing the Karmapa's seal. 

Tsikey Chokling, on the other hand, argued that a child is born from its mother 
and there is no tradition that allows for taking a child without its mother's con-
sent-and as Konchok Paldron had sworn never to give up her child, he should 
stay with her. 

In the end, it was decided that Chimey Dorje could stay in his mother's care. 

Looking back, I have to admit that as he grew up, my father became a bit of a 
rogue. In his younger days, despite being a tulku, his personality revealed an un-
usually gutsy side-a wild streak. By any standard, he didn't exactly seem a spiri-
tual person, much less a descendant of great masters. 

During this time, the younger brother of the Nangchen king had been given a 
large estate. This particular prince must have been greedy because he also usurped 
some land belonging to our family. 

My father was not shy about confronting him. The dispute escalated into a phys-
ical confrontation and 1 believe several people ended up dead. But the Nangchen 
palace indirectly backed the prince and my father couldn't fight against the king. 

Chimey Dorje now had to flee to Tsikey monastery. Since it was under the juris-
diction of Tsikey Chokling, the Nangchen royalty couldn't touch my father there. 
Instead of the quarrel continuing, messengers were sent back and forth until the 
dispute was settled. 

Later, my father became a ponpo chieftain in Nangchen. Dressing up like a 
tough guy in the good old Khampa fashion, he carried a long knife and a rifle, 
and would go out shooting everywhere. He would frequently become involved in

monastery in 
Nangchen 

disputes and lead his band of followers into battle. He delighted not just in con· 
frontations but in a good fight. Though incorrigible, he was brave and no one in 
the area could best him. 

You could say he had a taste for heroics. 

But finally my father's previous karma caught up with him in the form of an old 
hermit, a close friend of Sam ten Gyatso's. 

Being of serious mind, one day Samten Gyatso told my father, •1 am going to 
meet a great yogi; why don't you come along?• 

This master, Sontar ChOnchok, was a meditator who had spent most of his life 
in mountain hermitages. He was regarded as an emanation of Namkhai Nyingpo, 
one of the twenty-five close disciples of the Lotus-Born master. He grew up in 
Nangchen at the Tsechu monastery adjacent to the royal palace. He then asked to 
be excused from the monk's life and lived as a yogi. The first Tsoknyi was one of 
his teachers among several others. 

For years Chonchok traveled from one mountain retreat to another. Finally, he 
settled at a small hermitage above Neten monastery, where he remained until his 
death. He focused on nothing but meditation practice without being distracted by 
any mundane undertakings. As a result of his one-pointed practice, he became a 
Dzogchen master famous for his high level of realization. 



My Father, the Performer of Miracles 109 

Chonchok was a special friend of Samten Gyatso; they were each other's guru 
and disciple. For instance, they were Dharma brothers because they received the 
Treasury of Precious Termas from Tsewang Norbu at Riwoche at the same time. 
When Samten Gyatso wanted to clear up any doubts about his experiences, he 
would consult Chonchok. 

So my father went along as Samten Gyatso's attendant to the small hermitage 
in the z:nountains. When they arrived at the hermit's door, ChOnchok came out to 
greet Samten Gyatso, ·welcome, Rinpoche!· 

Then he noticed Chimey Dorje. ·Who have you brought with you?· he asked. 
"He's the reincarnation ofSonam Yeshe ofTsangsar; replied Samten Gyatso. 
"Ah, so the Sonam Yeshe incarnation has arrived! I have waited so long to meet 

him~ the yogi exclaimed as he began to bow down at my father's feet. 
Chimey Dorje tried to sidestep him, but Chonchok kept bowing in his direc-

tion, an expression of deep respect. 
"This is terrible!· my father thought to himself. ·How can this lama have such 

pure perception of a sinner like me? Look at me-I'm dressed like a bandit ready 
for a fight. I'm covered in weapons; yet this old lama has such devotion to my 
former incarnation that none of this makes any difference. 1 have hurt so many 
people-how I have wasted my life!· 

As these remorseful thoughts ran through my father's mind, the hermit kept 
bowing to him. Finally, the old yogi stopped. 

"Standing there with him bowing to me was much harder than any fight 1 had 
been in; my father later admitted to me. ·somehow he had touched me deeply~ 

By the time my father went inside, Sam ten Gyatso was already sitting comfort-
ably having a cup of tea. 

My father was so moved that he vowed to Samten Gyatso, •Today, in front of 
this lama, I promise never to repeat any of the evil deeds that 1 have made my way 
oflife~ 

"If you really mean it; replied Sam ten Gyatso, •then you should surely take that 
pledge. But if not, what's the use of making hollow promises you won't keep? It will 
only cause you grief." 

"But wouldn't it be best if I became a Dharma practitioner and learned from 
this hermit?• 

•That's up to you. If you have faith in him, then go ahead.1f you don't, then I'm 
not going to force you to do anything. He's a close friend of mine and we have 
shared many teachings; he's also one of my gurus. Personally I have faith in him. 



110 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

But you should follow your own heart. I never tell people they have to receiw 
teachings nor do I ever discourage anyone:' 

•1 have made up my mind,• my father replied. •From this moment until I die. I 
will behave like a Dharma practitioner!• 

So due to the skillful intervention of this old yogi, Chimey Dorje had a complett 
change of attitude. 

Determined to start right away Chimey Dorje told Sam ten Gyatso, •1 must re-
ceive teachings and practice. Please make this request on my behalf.' 

•All right, all right, that much I can do: Samten Gyatso said. •Go and find~ 
hermit,• who was still outside. 

Chimey Dorje went out and found Chonchok, and asked him to come in and 
sit with Samten Gyatso. 

·1 have something to ask of you,· my guru addressed the old yogi. •prease in· 
struct my brother in spiritual practice:' 

•No problem: Chonchok replied, •that 111 do:' Turning to Chimey Dorje, he 
continued, ·However, you will have to first swear an oath to me:' 

•sure. What is it?" 
•From this very day until you leave this life, whether you are a ngakpa or a 

monk, you have to wear the garb and shawl of a spiritual practitioner. There's no 
way around that! It is a sign of being a follower of the Buddha. 

·we live in the age the Buddha described as 'adhering to mere appearances: The 
three previous time periods have passed; in this fourth age, it is especially impor-
tant to adhere to some sign that represents the teachings of the Awakened One. 
So right now promise me that you will wear the practitioner's skirt, the sleeveless 
shirt and the shawl:'97 

Then and there Chimey Dorje pledged, •From this moment until I die, I will 
shed these mundane garments and wear only lama's clothes. And I will live up to 
them as well!• 

But having made the pledge, Chimey Dorje was puzzled, thinking, •What am 1 
supposed to do now? I don't have any other clothes with me:' 

Samten Gyatso came to his rescue, saying, •It just so happens I have an extra set 
of robes with me. They're not of very high quality, but maybe they'll do. I would be 
happy to let you have them:' 

Chimey Dorje put on his new robes, bowed his head to Chonchok and said 
•pJease cut my hair:' 



My Father, the Performer of Miracles 111 

Perhaps Chonchok saw that my father would soon take a consort and be a 
ngakpa rather than a monk. 

1 don't dare cut your hair~ he replied, ·since you are without a doubt the rein-
carnation ofSonam Yeshe. Instead there should be a special ceremony to enthrone 
you as his successor:' . 

My father was twenty-two years old at the time. He continued to request medi-
tation instructions from ChOnchok and regarded him as his root guru. 

From that day onward, my father became more gentle. 

One day my father had a vision of his guru riding a lion in the sky. Within this 
vision, his teacher then imparted the oral instructions on meditation practice, in-
cluding the pointing-out instruction to the awakened state of nondual awareness. 
From this vision it seems my father had received the blessing we call the transfer-
ence of realization. People say he totally changed from then on; hardly anyone was 
as mild-mannered as he." 

As he put it, •1 was no longer a rigid, relentless practitioner; it was like a clod of 
dirt had turned to dust. I felt totally free:' 

My father told me this personally, adding, •From that day on, my mind was like 
a sun shining from a cloudless sky:" 

And this is true-many people told me that from then my father was extremely 
gentle and treated everyone with respect and pure appreciation, no matter who 
they were. It would also appear that he had attained stability in nondual aware-
ness. For this reason my father considered Chonchok his ultimate root guru, say-
ing. ·nus master was the kindest to me!• 

Shortly after this having this vision news arrived of Chonchok's passing. 

During the latter part of his life, Chonchok reached the stage called the collapse 
of delusion-the final of four levels in Dzogchen, which in Mahamudra terms corre-
sponds to the stage of nonmeditation." He had perfected his meditation training. 

Samten Gyatso told me that the level of realization Chonchok achieved re-
sults in the rainbow body. Though he didn't show the rainbow body at the time 
of death, his body did shrink quite a bit after he died, a sign that he had definitely 
gone beyond delusion. When he passed away there were auspicious lights and 
sounds, ringse/ pills, and some wondrous designs of rainbows in the sky-just as 
the Dzogchen tantras describe for someone with such a high level of realization. 
Even Sam ten Gyatso was amazed. '00 



112 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

I can still remember my father's respect and devotion at even the mere men-
tion of Chonchok's name. If he had to say the name himself, he was barely able to 
speak, losing his voice for a while. His devotion was that deep. 

And that is why to this day we include Sontar ChOnchok in our daily chant to 
the lineage masters. 

Looking back, I see it was primarily thanks to Samten Gyatso and my father 
that I received the transmissions I have today. For instance, my father transmitted 
to me the entire corpus of the Buddha's words, which fills more than one hundred 
large volumes. He could read the whole Kangyur in three months, at a pace of 
about a thousand pages per day. His tongue was that agile. 

My father was fond of pilgrimage and would often interrupt serious teachings 
and ceremonies to take the day off on an outing, including a joyous picnic. But 
there were no interruptions when he gave a reading transmission. 

What's more, you could hear each word distinctly, so that at the end of a day 
of reading sutras aloud, most educated people could remember what the Buddha 
had said to whom and where, and were able to retell it to others. Three times he 
read the entire Kangyur aloud for others. 

Because Chimey Dorje had such a beautiful voice, wherever he went people 
would gather from near and far to listen to him. Of his many fine qualities, one of 
the best known was his power of mantra-probably a result of his vast number of 
practices and recitations related to the Mahayoga tantras. And when he did the 
Cho ceremony, it was particularly impressive-important families from the entire 
area, all the way to faraway Ziling, would invite him to perform rituals to support 
their health, prosperity and longevity. 

Perhaps his tongue had been blessed in some way, for it would be hard to find 
someone more articulate and with a voice that could project as far. When he 
chanted the Cho songs at his hermitage, they could be heard echoing across the 
entire valley. 

After his body was cremated, they found his tongue lying intact in the ashes. 

I shouldn't be saying this about my own father, but nevertheless it is true: 
Chimey Dorje was the only one of the four brothers known for performing mir-
acles. You could say it was part of his style. He had clairvoyant powers and also 
performed several miracles. 

Chimey Dorje had many visions of past masters and yidam deities. But, unlike 



My Father, the Performer of Mirades 113 

his brother Sam ten Gyatso, he didn't always keep his visions and premonitions to 
himself. I trusted in my father's clairvoyant abilities because I often heard state-
ments from his own mouth about matters that he could not possibly have known 
otherwise and which were later verified. For instance, before someone of impor-
tance would unexpectedly show up at his hermitage, he frequently would tell me 
that so-and-so was on the way. When I would ask who had sent the message, he 
would reply it had just occurred to him-and sure enough, a short time later the 
person would arrive. 

As for miracles, he did leave a set of footprints in a rock near our home at 
Tsangsar that I have seen myself and another set near Mount Gegyal-right beside 
a set left by Chokgyur Lingpa. And at his hermitage Dechen Ling, the Sanctuary of 
Great Bliss, there are imprints in solid rock of both his feet and his hands. 

Often people would ask my father for a prediction of how long they would live. 
Once an old lady asked him, •Eh, Rinpoche, how long do I have left?• 

"You have about three days; my father blurted out, without thinking. 
Immediately she wailed, •I only have three days? Oh, no, what am I going to 

do?!" 
Then my father softened the blow, saying, ·No, no-I said three months, at 

least." 
Again she wailed, ·oo I really have no more than three months? Please, can't 

you do something! 
"Sorry, but I meant three years; father offered. 
Two days later, Samten Gyatso asked my father to spend a few days with him 

and we went up to Fortress Peak. The next day we got a message that the old lady 
had died That was how precise his predictions could be. 

"It would be better not to give old people such bad news anymore; I advised 
my father. 

He laughed and said, ·so now I'm not allowed to give life predictions? This kid 
used to be my student-now I appear to be his.· 

I am sorry to say that one tends to have less appreciation and pure percep-
tion for a lama when he happens to be one's own father. Other people, however, 
regarded my father very highly, especially at Gebchak monastery, where they held 
a yearly drubchen of Tukdrub Barchey Kunsel for which he regularly gave the em-
powerment. 



114 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

One time, a brother of one of the Gebchak nuns had gotten into a lethal fight 
with someone from a powerful family. Having received news about the fight and 
convinced that her brother was dead, the nun came to request my father do the 
name-burning, a ritual that guides the dead to a better rebirth. 

•It's late now, so 111 do it in the morning; my father said. She left the room crying. 
In the morning, I began to prepare the shrine for the ceremony. But Chimey 

Dorje hadn't said anything about the ritual, so after a while I asked, ·shouldn't you 
start the ceremony, fatherr 

He replied, ·rm not sure what has happened, but I am certain her brother didn't 
die:' 

•What do you mean?·l asked. 
•If someone has died, their spirit always comes before me, but I don't feel any 

such thing today. So I'm convinced he's not dead:' 
After a while, the nun returned to make an offering for the ceremony; but I told 

her my father had said her brother wasn't dead. 
My father interjected, ·vou will get clearer news in two or three days:' 
And sure enough, it wasn't more than a couple of days before she learned the 

whole story-and, of course, her brother hadn't been killed after all. 

The innermost core of my father's practice was the Heart Essence of 
Samantabhadra and the Heart Essence of Chetsun, but the main framework for 
his practice was Cho. At one point the Cho tradition comprised over one hundred 
volumes.•o• Today probably only about eight survive, but they contain amazing 
teachings. 

The heart of Cho is to benefit others by cutting through ego-clinging. One 
basic principle involves transforming your material body into ambrosia, a divine 
food that you first offer to enlightened beings and then give away to sentient be-
ings. More advanced practitioners do this practice in a scary place, like a charnel 

·ground and there imagine their body turning into ambrosia that they give away to 
appease negative forces, spirits and unhappy ghosts. 

A goal of Cho is to reach perfection in the single nature of reality, which refers 
to the realization of Prajnaparamita, transcendent knowledge. This is also known 
as the samadhi of egolessness, the vajralike samadhi or ultimate truth. This real-
ization is identical with the quintessence of the twelve thick volumes of the Great 
Mother of Transcendent Knowledge, one of the most famous sutras in Mahayana. 
·The main teacher of the Cho system in Tibet; my father explained, •was the fe-
male master Machik Labdron, who attained realization by accomplishing the ul-



My Father, the Perfonner of Mirades 115 

timate intent of transcendent knowledge. After that, for the benefit of others, she 
would daily recite all twelve volumes. She had achieved the 'sixfold tongue accom-
plishment: whereby the capacity of one's speech is increased six times. People also 
saw her as having a third eye in her forehead: 

He would sometimes say to me, •How can there be any difference between 
the view of Prajnaparamita, which is the very essence of Cho, and the view of 
the Great Perfection? They are completely identical! Mahamudra, Dzogchen and 
Cho ultimately converge in the same awakened state-the ultimate transcendent 
knowledge. There isn't the slightest difference, is therer 

My father once explained, •The Cho system mentions four classes of demons: 
obstructive and unobstructive demons, demons of exuberance, and demons of 
indecision.'• A practitioner has to cut through all four. The obstructive demon 
refers to incarnate demonic forces, like Mao Zedong, for instance. The unobstruc-
tivedemon includes evil spirits of which there are thousands of kinds. The demon 
of exuberance means being seduced by success and followers, social status and 
recognition, which leads to fascination with the thought, 'I am truly special!' The 
fourth, the demon of indecision, is the source of all the others. The subtlest de-
mon, this consists in clinging to a point of view; it is identical to cognitive obscura-
tion, the most subtle veil that covers our buddha nature. 

"The sequence of Cho: my father said, •follows the general principles of tan-
tric practice. Then comes a particular retreat in which you perform the Jewel 
Garland, a long collection of Cho songs, once a day for one hundred days in a row. 
Alternatively, as the framework for the day's practice, you would use a shorter text, 
no more than six pages, known as the Single Seat Session or follow a similar text by 
Karma Chagmey. You would do that in the early morning and then throughout the 
day sing the various songs until one hundred days had passed. This was one way to 
measure a Cho practitioner's retreat. 

"Later you would do another set of one hundred days on a mountain, then at 
a river and then at a major bridge. Only when you had accomplished all four sets 
of one hundred days would you deserve the title of Cho practitioner. It wasn't 
enough just to buy a large drum and a bone trumpet, and claim to be such. 

"In the next phase, these Cho practices were done not only during the day-
time; you would go to scary places in the dead of night. At some point, the 
practitioner might face tests known as 'eruptions' or 'challenges; in which a local 
spirit would challenge your stability by creating magical apparitions of varying 
degrees of intensity: 



116 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

When I was a small child, people would try to scare me by saying that many 
practitioners have met their end during Cho practice. These eruptions could be 
dangerous. Some practitioners might become seriously ill, others go crazy and in 
rare cases some have even been known to die. 

•At one point in Cho practice,• my father continued, •you would have to 
spend one hundred nights in a cemetery where corpses were buried or a charnel 
ground where they were lying around.· In Kham we have places where up to 
ten thousand human bodies are buried, like some large cemeteries I've seen in 
Malaysia. 

•you would go alone to the cemetery,• my father continued, ·sing the ChO songs 
in utter darkness and be willing to go through any eruptions, facing these tests 
until the break of dawn. 

·sometimes if a meditator's practice were in fact just a mere simulation of a 
high level of meditative stability, the local spirits would conjure up a spectacle in 
the practitioner's field of experience enticing him to get caught up in delusions of 
grandeur. Then, once the practitioner felt assured of his achievement, he could be 
caught off guard by a simple scary vision. 

•True Cho practitioners, however, wouldn't take the bait but would simply 
carry on. Finally, they would be truly stable in all situations: cemeteries, remote 
valleys, marketplaces-anywhere. 

·When practitioners reached the point where even the most terrifying eruption 
couldn't perturb them, they would do a final set of Cho practice lasting seven days. 
Six of the seven days would typically be utterly serene. But then, on the seventh 
night, terrifying visions would occur. 

•At the least, meditators confronting an eruption should remind themselves 
that this is just a temporary experience, totally devoid of ultimate reality, and then 
remain composed in the continuity of the true view. Then, any such eruptions are 
nothing more than watching children play. 

·The moment you give in to fear; my father told me, •you have already failed 
the test.• 

When I was small, I heard quite a few scary stories from my father. Here is one 
of them. 

In eastern Tibet there was a cemetery where corpses were abandoned in a place 
between two cliffs. This spot was known to be extremely terrifying and strange 
things would often happen to practitioners who stayed there. 



My Father, the Performer of Miracles 117 

Precisely because of this terrifying reputation, my father went there one eve-
ning with two attendants. Since a Cho practitioner must be alone while doing his 
practice, his attendants had to remain at least eighty paces away. 

"After night fell; Chimey Dorje told me, •I began my practice. All of a sudden, 
something fell down from the sky right before me. When I looked closely, I saw 
a human head staring at me with glaring eyes, its tongue waggling. Suddenly, an-
other one fell down, then another and another. Each one made a loud 'Thump!' 
when it hit the ground. 

"One of them even hit me right on top of my head and I felt a sharp pain. 
After that the downpour became violent, like a hailstorm of human heads. They all 
seemed to be alive. Finally, the whole place was full of human heads, complaining 
and making horrible noises. Some coughed and moaned, 'I died of rotting lungs: 
Then they spat up globs of putrid phlegm.• 

Still my father didn't move. He continued his practice. 
"Eventually, the heads shrank in size and diminished in number, until finally 

they all had vanished without a trace: 
This exemplifies the kind of eruption we call ·challenges from magical displays 

by gods and demons: 
My father continued, •After a while, I stood up and walked over to see what had 

happened to my two attendants, who had been lying asleep in the middle of the 
hailstorm of human heads. They were still asleep and unperturbed; they hadn't 
noticed a thing: 

At one infamous place in Tibet skeletons are said to dance-and so of course 
my father also went there to practice Cho. Skeletons, known as ·bone demons; are 
greatly feared by Tibetans, as are ·skin demons· and ·hair demons: 

While my father practiced Cho at that place, male and female skeletons arrived 
to dance together all around him. They even performed elaborate folk dances in 
their efforts to scare him. 

"The dancing was not so hard to handle; he later said. •I simply continued my 
practice: 

The other kinds of demons showed up, too. ·The worst were the skin de-
mons, big sheets of human skin that would slowly float toward me in grotesque 
shapes. When they got very close, I felt an intense pain in my gut, as though I 
had been struck. Once again, I simply remained in the nondual state of aware-
ness, until the human skins shrank in size and finally vanished, just as the skel-
etons had.

•The hair demons were like big bundles of human hair that would swing back 

and forth in the sky in front of me, bouncing up and down. They staged all sorts of 
theatrics, until they too disappeared:" 

Once Chime Dorje was practicing Cho at Drak Yerpa, a famous cave hermitage 

near Lhasa; he had been asked to perform a healing ceremony there for a govern· 
ment dignitary. Since he had decided to perform ChO, he went to a charnel ground 

at night with an attendant. 
·When the attendant went to dispose of the effigy,• my father recounted, ·he 

vanished; he was nowhere to be found. I was left alone. Suddenly a huge army 

of monkeys appeared out of nowhere, all with grinning teeth and white beards. 
They threatened me, coming up to my face, touching and even biting me. As they 
grabbed for my hands, they felt solid and real. They were all dancing and baring 
their teeth viciously:" 

At first my father became frightened. But, on second thought, he reminded 
himself, ·There are no monkeys anywhere around here in Central Tibet. This is 
just another eruption, so what is there to be afraid oft 

The monkeys jumped closer and closer, stomping him to the ground. 
Nevertheless, Chimey Dorje thought, •There are no monkeys here! This must be a 

test! This much is certain: these demons are pretty astounding! They're trying their 

best to put up a frightening spectacle-and yet they only offer an opportunity to 
display my power of samadhL• 

My father never lost his confidence that ·an this is merely a show; it is not real· 

He simply continued his Cho chant without interruption. Gradually the monkeys 
shrank until they were the size of rats. Then they vanished 

In the end, there was only one tiny little monkey left, looking feeble and forlorn. 

It looked up at him in such a pathetic way that he couldn't help feeling compassion 
for it. 

·Just a few moments ago,· he thought, •you appeared so huge and horrendous. 

What use are all your powers to conjure magical displays? Now look at you-you 
pitiful little thing!• 

Chimey Dorje was famous for curing people-more so than his older brother 
Samten Gyatso. Sometimes sick villagers were carried to him from as far away as 
two or three weeks' journey. Once every week he would do the Cho ritual and they 

would recover-or not-and return home. 



My Father, lite Performer of Miracles 119 

During the ritual, the sick people had to lie down as if they had died, giving 
up all concerns. In his meditative state, Chimey Dorje would then open his ·cho 
eyes~ with which he could see the karmic causes of their diseases and the rem-
edies necessary for a swift cure. He would then announce his insights aloud for 
all to hear. 

When people heard why and in what circumstances they had fallen ill, they 
were often astounded. This did not cure everyone, but the morning after the Cho 
ritual, it would always be clear whether they would recover or not. 

My father cured a lot of people in this way and received plenty of gifts of grati-
tude as well as widespread respect. Ask any of the old people from my region-
they all remember Chimey Dorje and his Cho practice. 

Sometimes he was even able to cure people who had gone mad. Once at his 
hermitage a family carried in a woman bound with ropes and writhing angrily. I 
was there myself and witnessed the whole thing. 

1Jnless we keep her like this,• her husband said, ·she bites herself terribly. We 
can't talk sense to her or understand anything she says:' 

My father told the family to place her at a distance, all by herself. He then began 
the Cho ritual. After a while she stopped sneering, quieted down and became still. 
They untied her, but she just sat there. 

My father let her sit there, in the same position, for five days. On the second 
day, she looked as if she had just awakened from sleep, and immediately urinated 
and defecated right were she sat. She was carried off, cleaned up and brought back 
to the spot. By the third day, some color returned to her cheeks and some life to 
her eyes. 

On the seventh day, she walked home with the others on her own power. 

The master Dabzang Rinpoche told me that an epidemic once broke out at his 
monastery, Dilyak Gompa; in just one year, eighteen young monks died. At the 
same time, the monastery inhabitants were being spooked by strange sounds at 
night, until no one dared venture outside after dusk. Finally, no one had the cour-
age to visit the monastery and things became eerily quiet there. 

At some point, a messenger came to Dabzang with a white scarf from the great 
Situ. The message read, •Chimey Dorje ofTsangsar must be called upon to help. If 
he performs a healing ritual, your problems will be over:' 

When the request was made to my father, as he had a close link to the Dharma 
protector Gyalpo Pehar, he had a tiny image of this guardian made. The monks of 
Dabzang's monastery carried the image in a procession and placed it in the small 



120 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

shrine room for the guardians of the Buddha's teachings. The procession was ac-
companied by the sound of trumpets, gongs, cymbals and drums. He then told the 
monks to chant a short petition to the guardian with their daily liturgy. 

From then on, no further deaths occurred. All the nighttime sounds subsided 
as well. 

For three years, everything was fine-until a thief made off with that small stat-
ue. Then the disturbances began again. So my father had the monastery build a 
tiny protector temple at the foot of a huge boulder nearby and put a similar image 
there. After that, all was well. 

Once, the ponpo chiefs and their entourage from each of Derge's twenty-five 
districts were traveling north in a group of more than seven hundred. As they 
reached the other side of the small kingdom of Ling, their horses were stricken by 
a plague. 

The epidemic became so severe that thirty of their horses died in a single day. 
The whole party was forced to stop. Everyone was deeply worried-they felt they 
could neither proceed nor turn back. 

The chiefs sent a request for my father to come immediately. My brother Penjik 
journeyed with him. 

•yesterday, thirty of our horses perished. You are supposed to have some pow-
ers. What can be done?• they asked. 

•set up camp here: my father said. ·send people out to find firewood, a lot of it 
I will need to conduct a lavish fire ritual:" 

He soon began. In the distance, Penjik could see the corpses of the dead horses 
and a great many others that were already sick. The healthy horses were off graz-
ing separately. 

Suddenly, Chimey Dorje ordered, •Gather all the horses together-every one 
of them, no matter their state of health-on the plain here before me, in front of 
the fire. Mix the sick horses together with the healthy ones! According to the Cho 
tradition, we should totally let go of hope and fear. Separating the healthy from the 
sick is nothing but hope and fear, so give it up!• 

When they had done as he said, he began throwing special substances into the 
fire. At a certain point, he walked around the herd smearing each horse with what 
appeared to be grease from the fire. 

Then he commanded, •Let all the horses loose. Free them to roam where they 
please, without any hobbles, halters, saddles or other riding gear:" 



My Father, the Performer of Miracles 121 

My brother Penjik had incredible faith in our father; he had never once op· 
posed or disobeyed him. He regarded our father as his guru and ultimate refuge. 
Yet, when he was lying in the tent together with Chimey Dorje that evening, trying 
to go to sleep, he was scared. •I knew that a number of horses were already sick," 
he later told me, ·and I feared the moment when we would hear how many had 
died overnight: 

In the middle of the night, unable to sleep, Pcnjik and a servant quietly snuck 
out to look around the camp. They soon saw a horse so sick it couldn't stand up 
and then another that had already died. They dreaded going further. 

To their surprise as they proceeded they didn't find any other fatalities. My 
brother was then able to get some sleep, but was soon awakened by a cry, ·Another 
horse is dead!" 

"But that's the only one!" someone else yelled, •Ail the sick ones have begun to 
eat grass and drink water!" 

All that day, Chimey Dorje just sat there chanting the Vajra Guru mantra, un-
concerned. Not a single horse died after that. 

He was quite the marvelous dad. 

Several years after he returned from Central Tibet, my father began retreat at 
his main hermitage, Dechen Ling, the Sanctuary of Great Bliss. In total I believe 
he spent around thirty years in retreat there. It was there he left his body, when he 
was sixty·three years old. 

Before he died he told us, ·u there is any need for me to serve Chokgyur 
Lingpa's treasures, I will return and do so. But I would definitely not be happy if 
someone were forced to be my tulku. So don't look for any after I die!" 

That's why we never asked any masters to tell us where to find his next 
incarnation. 

Like their uncle, Tsewang Norbu, none of the four brothers was at all interested 
in having his next life recognized and so we didn't look for Uncle Tersey or Sang· 
Ngak's tulkus, either.

Two Special Uncles and 
Their Teachers 

UNCLE SANG-NGAK 

The Karmapa recognized Sang-Ngak, my third uncle, as a tulku.•os The Karmapa 
told the tulku's monastery where he could be found and, as was the custom, the 
lamas there had to send a letter to my grandparents to inform them. This was just 
after my father's abduction and Konchok Paldron was still deeply upset. 

·one of my sons has just been abducted; she told the messenger. •And now you 
have come to do the same with his younger brother, Sang-Ngak? 

·u this is true; she added with a tone of sarcasm, •please tell me now, so I can 
watch the spectacle! For you will never hear any word of consent crossing my 
lips-of that you can be sure! Already the eldest has been recognized as the rein· 
carnation of Ngaktrin and carried off to Lachab. My second son has been ripped 
from my hands and taken off to another monastery. The great Khyentse predicted 
my youngest was the rebirth of my late brother, Wangchok Dorje, and he has been 
taken away to Tsikey, my father's seat. 

•All I have left is Sang-Ngak and I need a son in the house to help me. Now 
you've come for him-are you going to act like brutes and take him by force?• 

You could say that this was bad timing for that monastery because Grandmother 
got pretty angry. Still heavy with sadness over having lost Chimey Dorje, she never 
gave her permission for Sang-Ngak to be taken away and without her consent 
there was nothing the monastery could do. So Uncle Sang-Ngak remained with 
our Precious Mother and was of tremendous help to her, serving as cook and 
household manager for the first half of his life. 

His greatest quality was perfect recall, so whatever Konchok Paldron taught 
him he never forgot. In this way, it was through my grandmother that Sang-Ngalc 
learned the entire tradition of Chokgyur Lingpa, especially the melodies for all the 
chants and the details of the various tormas. After his mother passed away, it was 



Tlvo Special Uncles and Their Teachers 123 

Uncle Sang-Ngak who carried on the authentic knowledge of chants and tormas 
for the New Treasures. 

Uncle Sang·Ngak became a monk while still young and he kept his vows with 
grea~ integrity. He truly upheld the three levels of precepts: outwardly the ethical 
vowsofindividualliberation, inwardly the bodhisattva trainings and on the inner-
most level the sacred bonds of Vajrayana. He was honest, noble and learned-a 
first..cJm practitioner. 

Mter my grandmother passed away, he spent most of his life in retreat. He only 
slept a little bit at night. To be honest, I haven't met anyone who was more per-
severing; he did nothing but meditate, primarily in retreat. Like Sam ten Gyatso 
and my father his main practices were the Heart Essence of Samantabhadra 
and the Heart Essence ofChetsun. He had extraordinary experience and realiza-
tion. 

Never famous like his brother Samten Gyatso, he had neither great sponsors 
nor obligations. He was a fine hidden yogi, kept a very low profile and had an 
easygoing personality. His was the simple life of a meditator, which was a very 
good life indeed. 

That's the kind of lama he was. 

Uncle Sang-Ngak and I lived together for several years at Fortress Peak with 
Samten Gyatso. Uncle Sang-Ngak often acted as his older brother's assistant, serv-
ing him in many ways. Even though he too was a tulku, he never claimed to be 
Samten Gyatso's equal. 

Uncle Sang-Ngak received the pointing-out instruction and all the pithy advice 
on meditation from Sam ten Gyatso, and he never went to any other teacher about 
such matters. He had such respect that he would never remain seated when his 
older brother entered the room-as if Sam ten Gyatso was the Karmapa in person. 
You rarely see that kind of respect among siblings. 

Only after Samten Gyatso passed away could Uncle Sang-Ngak be forced to 
confer any empowerments from the New Treasures, something he adamantly re-
fused to do before. There was just one exception. 

Once at Fortress Peak Samten Gyatso forced him to give the empowerments 
for the Three Sections of the Great Perfection because Uncle Sang· Ngak alone held 
Kanney Khenpo's lineage. First Samten Gyatso made him give us the empower-
ments, which took almost a week. As soon as Uncle Sang-Ngak was done, Samten 
Gyatso very carefully gave the whole set of empowerments all over again to Uncle 
Sang-Ngak, my father and me. 104

Later on, many people told me that whenever Uncle Sang-Ngak was the ritu-
al helper for Samten Gyatso during empowerment ceremonies, he was like a cal 
Unlike most, he was never clumsy while handling the objects on the elaborately 
complex shrine arrangements, never spilled a drop of anything, never stumbled 
over anyone no matter how busy he got. His footsteps never made a sound, a skill in 
which he had obviously trained, nor did he make undue noise in any other activity. 

Uncle Sang-Ngak didn't have many students, and he never gave meditation 
instructions-unlike his brothers, who were known everywhere, like the moon 
and stars. In his later years, though, his renown grew and people from all around 
showed more devotion to him; they had started to appreciate that through his 
mother he held the direct lineage from Chokgyur Lingpa. In this way, the trans-
mission of the New Treasures came to rest on him, since there was no one else 
with such purity of lineage. 

Later in my life, while in retreat at a hermitage above Tsurphu, I received the 
news that he had passed away.•os 

TERSEY TULKU 

My uncle Tersey, the youngest of the four brothers, had originally gone to Central 
Tibet on pilgrimage, but even after several years passed had not returned home 
to I<ham. This eventually prompted my grandmother's search to bring him back 
home. 

Uncle Tersey had traveled far and wide, even visiting India and Bhutan, making 
pilgrimage after pilgrimage. In this way, he had stayed in Central Tibet for ap-
proximately eight years in the first part of his adult life. 

Tersey had quite a powerful personality. He once led a large group of people to 
safety when they were threatened by bandits on their pilgrimage around Mount 
Kailash. Because of such exploits, Tersey became famous for his deftness. 

He was known as •the bearded Tersey Rinpoche,· where Tersey signifies being 
the tulku of Chokgyur Lingpa's son, the handsome, long-haired Wangchok Dorje •. 
who died at twenty-four after cutting his hair. 

Uncle Tersey's root guru was the master Shakya Shri. During his long absence 
from home, my uncle lived at Shakya Shri's encampment when he wasn't on his 
occasional pilgrimage journeys. 

Back in Kham, Uncle Tersey's status had been equal to that of the two rein-
carnations of Chokgyur Lingpa and their thrones were of the same height during 



Tlvo Special U11cles and 71teir Teachers 125 

ceremonies at the great terton's main seats.'o6 Tersey was an elegant writer who 
arranged many manuals for the procedure of giving the empowerments in the 
New Treasures. He also wrote an explanation of all the deities in the Tukdrub 
practice-all this in spite of never having had any serious education. Someone 
11ith deep insight can often teach as well as a learned khenpo. 

At some point, the need arose for Tersey to carry on the New Treasures, and 
fulfill his main duties at Tsikey and the other monasteries. That was why his moth-
er and three brothers all went off to Central Tibet to find him, and bring him back 
to Nangchen . 
. Still, it took them five years to get Uncle Tersey back to Kham. At the end of 

his life, Uncle Tersey took up residence at the retreat center above Tsikey. By then 
he was suffering from an illness that forced him to walk with two canes. I heard 
that this might have been a punishment from the dakinis, carried over from his 
previous life, due to his taking monastic ordination rather than being a tantric 
practitioner. 107 

Uncle Tersey's main practices were the Heart Essence ofChetsun and the Heart 
Essence ofSamantabhadra. In addition, he was really fond of a particular practice 
of the Lotus-Born master known as Guru Mahasukha, a mind treasure of Shakya 
Shri that he had received personally from that terton himself. 

I heard that Uncle Tersey displayed miracles and had clear foreknowledge on 
several occasions, but he refused to confirm such things himself. In this way, he 
showed true integrity.•"' 

Once Samten Gyatso remarked to Uncle Tersey, •tt seems that even high medi-
tators, for some reason, have to lose consciousness for a moment or two while in 
the state between waking and falling asleep-even though, of course, our basic 
awakened state doesn't lose its cognizant quality. If the rest of the time confusion 
~as vanished, not only in the waking state but also at night, that signifies achieving 
the level of a great bodhisattva: 

~But even below that level; Uncle Tersey replied, ''I'm not sure a bodhisattva 
\von't fall back into samsara or even into hell: 

Uncle Tersey sometimes made such outlandish remarks.'09 

You may remember that the fifteenth Karmapa had wanted to receive the trans-
inission of the New Treasures from Chokgyur Lingpa's son Tsewang Norbu. Since 
that proved impossible, as his next choice the Karmapa sent for Tersey. 



126 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

Uncle Tersey was extremely learned and paid great attention to details, so he 
was highly qualified to give the New Treasures in a very precise way. After Tersey 
arrived in Central Tibet, the Karmapa sent him a message. 

To make this request-as he had before with the terton's son Tsewang Norbu-
the Karmapa once again sent Jampal Tsultrim, his most trusted servant. 

·The Karmapa requests that you come to Tsurphu and give him Chokgyur 
Lingpa's New Treasures," Jam pal Tsultrim told my uncle. 

Like his brother Samten Gyatso, Uncle Tersey was a hidden yogi type, who al-
ways tried to avoid the spotlight. So he responded, "This is utterly ridiculous! Why 
are you making this demand?"uo 

•It's not I who am asking you to do this; replied Jampal Tsultrim. "It's the 
Karmapa giving you his command:' 

Then they got into a heated argument. Finally, Jampal Tsultrim gave in to his 
Golok temperament and slapped Uncle Tersey across the face, yelling, ·You low-
life!" and burst out of the room. He then walked off. 

On returning to the Karmapa, he said, "This Tersey Tulku is impossible-the 
lowest of the low! I argued with him, but he utterly refuses to come:' 

The fifteenth Karmapa merely replied, "That's all right. Wc11 see." 
The Karmapa was right not to be upset. He then invited Samten Gyatso to 

come to Tsurphu, without telling him exactly what the purpose of the visit was. 

Uncle Tersey was known to be very meticulous. Once at Tana monastery, half a 
day's ride on horseback from my own place, Uncle Tersey was asked to confer the 
empowerment for Padmasattva, the wisdom-body of Chokgyur Lingpa. 

He began his preparations at the break of day, performing the sadhana alone 
down to the recitation-which then went on and on, not finishing the preparation 
before the sun had set! 

Tersey was the kind oflama who would retain the meditative states of develop-
ment and completion during the entire empowerment ceremony. His painstaking 
way of doing these things was quite unusual, since other masters could easily give 
fifteen to twenty empowerments in a single day. But not our Tersey. When he 
finally began conferring the empowerment, he would teach in thorough detail on 
the six types of liberation and then go on to guide the disciples through personal 
experience .... 

In this way, Tersey's empowerment lasted the whole night. If he hadn't been a 
lama, people would have gotten really annoyed at him. 

At one point, he almost gave up giving empowerments entirely. 



7ivo Special Uncles and Their Teachers 127 

•I can't give them anymore; he told me. 
•Why not, Rinpoche?" 
"The empowerment preparation should be stable and authentic; he replied. 

"Otherwise I just don't feel satisfied. And the minimum number of recitations 
during the preparation should exceed many thousands for each mantra. But when 
I do this, it takes all day~ 

In our region, we still use the saying, •giving empowerments like Tersey Tulku• 
(or si>meone being meticulous in the extreme. 

One prominent trait of masters with a sense of integrity is that they never boast 
about or make any public display of their inner spiritual qualities. My uncle Tersey 
was like that. 

•It was the great Khyentse; Uncle Tersey once said to me, •who proclaimed 
me a tulku of Chokgyur Lingpa's son and there is nothing that escapes the reach 
of his lcnowledge, since he sees the three times as clear as day. Wangchok Dorje, 
Chokgyur Lingpa's son, was an emanation of King Jah, who received the eighteen 
Mahayoga tantras on the roof of his palace. 

•5o if I am supposed to be the emanation of such masters, I should feel a little 
special somehow. Shouldn't an emanation of King Jah at the very least have some 
mental clarity? But when I look into my own mind, I see only the complete dark-
ness of ignorance and confusion. So I can't be sure that I am such an emanation. 

"Luckily, the great master Shakya Shri introduced me to the awakened state 
with these words: 'Listen to me carefully. The awakened state cannot possibly 
change. Do you hear me? Once you notice this empty, awakened state, in which 
there is no thing that can change, then there is no need to create it by meditating 
nor is it something that can truly slip away. Do you understand? Once you have 
recognized that which cannot change, that's the awakened state. Now keep it in 
mind, always. Trust me, this is very important! The awakened state is the most 
important thing: 

"Those were Shakya Shri's last words to me and, even though my meditation 
state is still one of utter darkness, they contain the only thing I feel certain of.' 

When he made remarks like that, we would usually break out laughing, but 
Uncle Tersey would continue with a deadpan expression on his face. 

"If I say that I'm not an emanation, it would be the same as calling the great 
Khyentse a liar-and I wouldn't dare do that! But every once in a while, I carefully 
scrutinize myself to see if I can find any perfect qualities and I can't find a single 
one. I draw a complete blank~ 



128 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

Again we would laugh. He was that kind of lama. 
In spite of what he said about himself, Uncle Tersey was not only a close dis· 

ciple of Shakya Shri but an extraordinary master in his own right. 

When both Karmey Khenpo and Tsewang Norbu had left this world, my uncle 
Tersey was the most learned in Chokgyur Lingpa's New Treasures, as well as a 
capable writer. As long as he was alive, you didn't need to rely on any other master 
for writing any needed manual. 

After his return from his extended pilgrimage Uncle Tersey stayed for a year or 
two at Tsangsar and then for a couple of years at Fortress Peak, the lofty hermit· 
age linked to my monastery. Being the most learned and competent writer of the 
four brothers, he passed this time codifying the many texts for rituals and medita· 
tion practices needed in his grandfather's lineage. Although no one seems to have 
compiled Uncle Tersey's writings after he died, there must have been enough to 
fill more than five volumes. He did a lot to develop the practices found in the New 
Treasures. m 

When Uncle Tersey was near the end of his days, he announced, ·oeath will 
come soon. 1 am leaving this year.· 

Then he personally supervised the distribution of every single thing he owned. 
specifying which item should go to which lama or monastery. He managed to 
clear everything out and be totally free of possessions, except for one item: a terma 
treasure in the form of a tiny little statue of the Lotus-Born. 

At an earlier point in his life, he had vowed to recite ten million VAJRA GURU 
mantras and during this recitation retreat he kept this statue concealed in a pure 
gold amulet box inside a small brocade bag. He treated it with tremendous respect 
and would say, •1 regard this little statue as being Padmasambhava in person. I 
didn't have the good fortune to meet him otherwise. But the Lotus-Born made 
this statue out of sand from Lake Manasarovar at Kailash and has infused it with 

. his wisdom-being:'111 
I was told that after Tersey had finished giving everything away, it was no more 

than three days before he fell ill and died. The last thing he did before passing on 
was to insert the tiny statue inside the heart center of a newly completed Buddha 
statue, the size of a fully grown man. 

He then said, •Now I'm done, come what may:' 
Later the communists destroyed everything at Tsikey monastery-including 

that Buddha statue.

Sha/(ya Shri, 
the Lord ofSiddhas 

During his stay in Central Tibet, Uncle Tersey frequented the encampment of 

his root guru Shakya Shri, the great siddha-master. Shakya Shri was also known 
as the Lord of Siddhas and as Precious Realized Master. His main guru was Old 
Khyentse.114 

."Shakya Shri lived with about seven hundred disciples in Kyipuk; Uncle Tersey 
told me. •His disciples had dug caves all around the two surrounding slopes, while 
others stayed in tiny tents made of either canvas or yak-felt. Shakya Shri himself 
lived on a meadow in the only house around, which was a simple structure of 
stamped mud with one large window:' 

: .. People revered Shakya Shri immensely. But he had not always been so widely 
·respected, as a story I heard shows-one that 

mayor may not be included in his official bi-

ography. 
Shakya Shri's first teacher was the great 

master Khamtrul. Shakya Shri started out 
caring for his master's horses and doing oth-
er manual labor. On one occasion, the yogi 
Tsoknyi was invited to Khamtrul's camp to 
bestow the empowerment of his own mind 

treasure."5 As the ceremony began, Shakya 

Shri took the opportunity to slip in and sit by 
the door. At this time, no one regarded him 

as special in any way. 
"What do you think you are doing here? 

Get out!• some of the monks turned around 
and whispered. ·This is not for someone like 

you, only for lamas and Dharma teachers.

Didn't you hear the announcement? This isn't for everyone!" 
The monks were about to throw him out, when they suddenly felt Tsoknyfs 

gaze. 
"Let him stay!" he thundered, "You all sit down. A day will come when you 

won't even be given the chance to drink his pee!" 
Tsoknyi made sure that Shakya Shri stayed to receive the empowerment and 

eventually Shak')'a Shri became an accomplished master. 

Even though so many disciples had gathered around him, Shakya Shri didn't 
teach year round but only at particular times during summer and winter. These 
rare occasions were known as the summer teachings and the winter teachings. 

Shakya Shri told some of his disciples, "You belong to the Mahamudra side 
of the valley," while to others he said, "You belong to the Dzogchen side." And 
so he divided them up in two groups and gave instructions in Mahamudra and 
Dzogchen in accordance with each follower's individual disposition. My uncle 
Tersey belonged to the Dzogchen group."6 

Uncle Tersey explained, ·The rules were quite strict: stay put on your medita· 
tion seat. The meditators were allowed to walk about only at mealtimes. In the 
morning, a bell would sound, signaling that the practitioners could light their fires 

to heat water for tea. All seven hundred monks and nuns would come out of their 
tents and caves. 

"If you were to look around the mountainside then, for a short while people 
would be milling about with smoke rising from the fire pits. Then the gong would 
sound again and the whole area became completely still and deserted, as every· 
one returned to their meditation. The total quiet would last until lunchtime, since 

no one was allowed to walk outside or cook until 
then. Around noon the bell would sound again for 
everyone to begin preparing their meals. At two 
in the afternoon, the bell rang, after which not a 
single soul was permitted outside. Again it would 
be utterly still~ 

This was the amazing Dharma encampment 
Shakya Shri maintained. 

Being a siddha, Shakya Shri would remain de-
tached and indifferent no matter who came, with 



Shakya Shri, the Lord ofSiddhas 131 

two exceptions. One was Drukpa Yongdzin, the rebirth of one of Shakya Shri's 
gurus; when he arrived, the master would show particular respect, saying, "Be 
on your toes! Yongdzin Rinpoche has come!" The only other exception was the 
highly renowned reincarnation of Chokgyur Lingpa's son-who happened to be 
my uncle Tersey. Everyone else was treated with equal detachment, no matter 
who they were. 117 

lrt those days, Uncle Tersey and Yongdzin must have been young. But they were 
the only ones who were allowed to do as they pleased; everyone else was supposed 
to begin and end their meditation sessions at exactly the same times. 

One day, when the two of them had been playing around, Shakya Shri called 
them into his house. 

"You two!" the old yogi master rumbled. "Don't disturb other people's medi-
tation! Your own practice may be undisturbed, but don't make obstacles for 
.others!• 

That was the only time they got a scolding. 

In the afternoon, Shakya Shri usually went outside to relieve himself. He would 
.,-alk out back in the large yard and squat. Then he would come back in and sit 
down on his mat, simply remaining there in utter stillness. 

But sometimes dusk would fall and it would get dark, and he still hadn't re- · 
turned. Then Shakya Shri's servants would say to one another, "Rinpoche is ab-
sorbed in samadhi again!" 

Then one of the attendants would walk out back, find him and whisper, 
"Rinpoche, you better come in now:" 

Shakya Shri would then boom in his deep voice, "Ah! The stars are already spar-
kling!" and walk back to the house. 

Once the king of Bhutan sent yaks packed with loads of rice escorted by thirty 
men, up through the perilous paths in the district of Lhodrak, as an offering to the 
siddha master. In an accompanying letter, the king explained that he had included 
an expensive bowl of Chinese porcelain in one of the sacks of rice. 

The carriers were supposed to present the master with the china bowl imme-
diately. On their arrival, they began a frantic search for the bowl, poking through 
one rice sack after another, right there in front of Shakya Shri. 

After a while, Shakya Shri pointed his finger and boomed, "The bowl is in that 
sack over there!" 



132 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

Sure enough they looked inside and found it. He had that kind of clairvoyant 
power, although he would never admit it if you asked him. 

Three times in his life Shakya Shri got rid of all his possessions, sending them to 
Lhasa to be given away as offerings. There is a well-known tradition for doing this: 
you keep only the clothes you are wearing, a cup, a bowl and a spoon, and a few 
other basic utensils. Everything else is packed up to be dispersed, without even a 
needle and thread left behind. 

The people who witnessed this saw that for a very long time afterward he re-
mained totally free of any possessions. For a while he even refused to accept of· 
ferings of any kind. 

During one of these periods, my uncle Tersey was in possession of a beautiful 
gilded statue that he sincerely wished to offer to his guru. However he knew that 
there was no chance that Shakya Shri would accept it if he presented it under nor· 
mal circumstances. So he simply showed it to the master. 

•What do you think of the proportions?· my uncle inquired. ·Are they correctr 
After a series of such questions, he finally asked, ·What kind of merit would result 
from offering something like thisr 

In the end, the statue became one of the only objects that Shakya Shri accepted 
during those years. 

Uncle Tersey later said, •This was one of the times in my life J was truly able to 
put illusory wealth to good use:' 

My uncle Tersey told me the following story when I was a kid. He was one of 
my teachers and never lied. If he hadn't personally witnessed it with his own eyes, 
I certainly wouldn't have believed it. But he assured me that this did happen. 

Many strange people visited the encampment of Shakya Shri. Once there was 
a big commotion and crowds began to gather. Tersey went out to see what all the 
fuss was about. 

An old lama from the distant Golok province had just entered camp. After a 
while, his attendant arrived carrying his baggage. The attendant caught up with 
him in the center of the camp. 

Then the lama shouted •phey!• and the attendant just fell flat on the ground. 
Much to everyone's amazement, the lama nonchalantly took the luggage off 
the attendant's body and set about cooking dinner for himself under the open 
sky. 



Shakya Shri, tire Lord ofSiddhas 133 

"Don't get too close. Just leave that body alone!" the lama shouted to the crowd. 
Uncle Tersey was present when the lama later explained to Shakya Shri what 

was going on. "I have come from Golok on foot, and that body is my benefactor's 

corpse. After death he became a ro/ang' -a walking dead-"and now I'm taking 
'his corpse to one of the big charnel grounds in India to dispose of it there. Since 
the zombie can walk, I thought it might as well carry my bundle. Don't let anyone 

near it. Tell them to leave the corpse alone and not make a commotion~ 

But of course no one could be kept away. Everyone wanted to see the corpse 
that carried luggage. It was as dry as a stick, its eyes were closed, and all the skin 

and flesh on the soles of its bare feet had worn down to the bone. No one could 
quite believe it. 

The next morning, the lama woke up and made some breakfast. When he was 

done eating, he performed the ritual of burnt food, probably to "feed" the zombie 

on the fumes, as it didn't eat or drink anything. Then he packed his bags on the 

back of the corpse and shouted "phey!" 
The corpse immediately stood straight up and, unable to keep its balance when 

standing still, started to stagger slowly, one foot after the other. The lama headed 
off with the zombie trailing behind him, the bones of its feet creaking and clacking 
and making scraping noises against the pebbles and hard ground. 

"It always walks at the same slow pace," he had told Shakya Shri. "I have to keep 
within view, otherwise it loses its way. \xrhen I climb to the top of a mountain pass, 

24.

134 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

I have to wait there until the zombie slowly climbs up after me. Then, I continue 
on down the other side and wait below until it catches up. 111 come visit again on 
my way back from India:' 

The old lama didn't ask for any teachings nor did Shakya Shri ask him any ques-
tions. He simply had his morning meal and left. 

After he had disappeared from sight, Shakya Shri exclaimed, ·wow! Now that's 
incredible!. This was one of the amazing feats that someone can perform after at· 
taining stability in the awakened state. 

After a year passed, the lama came back through the encampment. 
•My kind benefactor's body carried my provisions all the way to India~ he said 

•I left his remains there at the Cool Grove charnel ground and walked back by my· 
self. On the way down, I had to be careful to keep the zombie in sight all the time 
because I noticed that people fall unconscious if they touch it; some even become 
paralyzed or go mad for a while. So how could I have let him walk about in Tibet? 
The gravest danger with a zombie is that you too will become a zombie if it has the 
opportunity to touch you on your head. That's why people shouldn't touch him." 

Uncle Tersey later told me, •I was never really sure if this lama wasn't just play· 
ing a joke. Who knows? Maybe there wasn't a mind in that dead body. Someone 
who has reached a certain degree of stability in the awakened state can move 
material objects around at will. Nevertheless, if the lama was playing a big joke on 
everyone, it was quite a remarkable joke!• 

He must have been an accomplished yogi-not because he was able to animate 
a corpse but because he didn't need to ask Shakya Shri any questions. That's what 
has stuck in my mind all these years.

The Master-Scholar 
J(atokSitu 

The author of Shakya Shri's biography was Katok Situ, a great scholar from Katok 
monastery. Once when Katok Situ visited Central Tibet, he also came to the seat 
of the Drukchen Jamgon-one of the most prominent lamas in the Drukpa Kagyu 
school-and was then invited up to Kyipuk, Shakya Shri's mountain hermitage 
higher up the valley. 

He arrived at Kyipuk just after Shakya Shri had passed away; though my uncle 
Tersey was still there. Shakya Shri's lama disciples discussed who would be the 
best person to write the master's biography, and they decided upon the learned 
and eloquent Katok Situ. It fell to Uncle Tersey to make the request. 

"Our master was very remarkable; my uncle said. •pJease write the story of his 
life." 

"Very well: replied Katok Situ. ·oo you have the record of his deeds? Bring me 
his records!• 

Traditionally, lamas write notes in a calendar listing the empowerments and 
reading transmissions they have received and given, the practices done, as well 
as other important events and deeds. Katok Situ read Shakya Shri's diary of short 
notes late into that same night. 

During the following days he would give teachings and in the evenings he wrote 
by the light of a lamp. In less than a week-before he left the camp-Katok Situ 
had completed a wonderful biography. ua 

"I studied the many topics of philosophical scriptures and traditional sciences: 
lhe learned Mipham once told Katok Situ. •xn that way, I have been carried away 
by distractions in the name of the Dharma. 

"Shakya Shri, on the other hand, has exclusively practiced Mahamudra and 
Dzogchen while remaining in the mountains. Shakya Shri raised the victory 



136 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

banner of realization in a single lifetime. If we were to compare our realization. 
his would be greater! 

•The reason for this is simple: he didn't distract himself with a lot of studies of 
philosophy and the five sciences, but focused simply on the key points of the paths 
of Mahamudra and Dzogchen. This lord of siddhas practiced day and night:" 

Let me explain why Katok Situ had come all the way from Kham on this trip to 
Central Tibet. 

Almost a thousand years ago, many tantras and sadhanas were brought from 
India and translated into Tibetan, primarily by Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra and 
Vairotsana and their disciples.''' Some of the explanatory texts that clarify the 
tantras were lost over the millennium. 

One scripture in particular, the renowned Armor Against Darkness, was a 
clarification of Anu Yoga practice according to an original tantra known as the 
Scripture of the Great Assemblage. This commentary, written by Sangye Yeshe 
of Nub, one of the Lotus-Born's twenty-five disciples, had vanished centuries 
ago. 

For some reason, Katok Situ took it upon himself to find the lost text, leaving 
no stone unturned in order to include it in the collection of important scriptures. 
So wherever he would go, he stopped at various monasteries, searching through 
every library all along his way. 

During his stay in Lhasa, Katok Situ asked my uncle Tersey to assist him. Tersey, 
of course, couldn't pass up this special opportunity to accompany the learned mas-
ter through the regions of U and Tsang. 

Prior to their arrival in Shigatse, they had sent a letter ahead asking permission 
to visit Tashi Lhunpo monastery, the seat of the Panchen Lama, and look through 
its vast libraries. The reply came: •you can have permission, but it will be very 
costly. The chief librarian, the bursar of the monastery and the chief disciplinar-
ian, plus other monastery staff must all be present. You will not be allowed to look 
through a single book on your own. Taking all the necessary people into account. 
the fees for research in our library will include food and wages for forty people. 
And we can only set aside seven days for you. If you can cover the expenses, then 
you can have access:" 

Katok Situ was a lama of means and he readily accepted these demands, reply-
ing, ·very well, I will spend seven days searching through your library:" 

The master-scholar from Katok began the search, but after seven days, the book 
had still not been found. Katok Situ was quite disheartened. 



The Master-Scholar Katok Situ 137 

"What an awful shame!· he exclaimed. •1 was fairly sure we'd find this book at 
Tashi Lhunpo. But now there is little chance of ever recovering it anywhere:' By 
this point he had looked through the libraries of most major Nyingma and Kagyu 
monasteries. My uncle said he looked very sad indeed. 

Katok Situ wasn't staying in the monastery but with a family nearby. It then 
happened that a girl in her late teens from a common family came to see Katok 
Situ. She asked ·him to bless her by placing his hand on her head. 

At the moment he touched her, she seemed to change. Just as the scriptures 
describe how the dakinis communicate in gestures and symbolic words, the girl 
began to move her hands in unusual ways, as though indicating something to 
Katok Situ. 

Then she performed an elaborate dance, singing in Sanskrit and ending the 
mses with •Ah la la ho!· Finally, she repeated one line, •The Armor Against 
Darkness clarifies the Anu Yoga scripture. Ah Ia Ia ho!• 

No one present had the least idea what she was talking about. •It's so embar-
rassing; one person remarked, ·that some patrons let a crazy girl in to visit such a 
great master. What an arrogant kid! Let's drag her out!• 

They were about to grab hold of her when Katok Situ told them to leave her 
~one. Having repeated the line about the book again, she bowed her head to re-
ceive a blessing from his hand. Then she stood up and walked out as if nothing 
had happened. 

As soon as she had left the room, Katok Situ said to Tersey and his other at-
tendants, ·well, now! It seems we have to go back and take another look. I think 
there might still be a chance that we will find it. You must go back up to Tashi 
Lhunpo and ask permission to continue the search. I will start over, beginning 
v.ith the libraries on the upper floor and working my way down. I don't care if 
they charge as much as last time-I would be happy to pay it! Let's hear what they 
have to say:' 

My uncle said he hiked back up the stairs and made the request. The adminis-
trator he dealt with replied, •You have already looked and found nothing, didn't 
)'OU? And now you want to do it all again! It looks to me like you want to throw 
your money away-but if that's what you want to do, go right ahead!• 

When my uncle relayed the news of the approval, despite the price Katok Situ 
was overjoyed and immediately sent him back up with the money. They com-
menced the search that same day. The text was found five days later. 

Katok Situ was really lucky that time because it was Sangye Yeshe of Nub's 
own commentary, the very master who had brought the Anu Yoga teachings to 
Tibet. 



138 SPIRITUAL ROOTS 

Afterward, he told my uncle that a dakini had come to him in the form of that 
girl. That is why the Armor Against Darkness is still available to us today. 

Word had spread that Katok Situ was a great scholar. So, during his stay in 
Lhasa, as soon as dusk fell over the city, groups of a half dozen or so of the most 
learned geshe scholars from Sera, Drepung and Ganden monasteries would come 
to debate with him. 

•If all these people keep coming; my uncle thought, •it will be a burden for the 
old master. Maybe I should go and lock the door:' 

When he went to the door, he peeked through the crack. He saw that the schol-
ars were already engaged in a discussion with Katok Situ, taking turns in direct-
ing an attack on the master's philosophical position, slapping their hands as they 
went, in typical Tibetan-style debate. In the beginning, their voices were so loud 
it almost made your ears ring. Slowly the volume diminished. After a while, the 
main voice he could hear was that of Katok Situ. In the wee hours of the night, the 
geshes took leave one by one, touching heads with Katok Situ and thanking him 
for his time. 

As they went out the door, Uncle Tersey heard one of them remark, •Amazing 
that there is such a learned master alive! I wonder if any debater could beat him. 
He appears invincible:' 

This scene played out over and over during their stay in Lhasa, and Katok Situ's 
fame spread even wider. 

Upon his return to Kham, Katok Situ built a most exquisite replica of Padma-
sambhava's celestial mansion-the Palace of Lotus Light on the Glorious Copper-
Colored Mountain-with many bronze statues unequaled in Tibet. 

Later, he was sent to China as an emissary to attend an important political 
meeting. But on his way, having reached an advanced age, he departed for the 
buddhafields. uo 

And as for that glorious mansion he built? The Chinese invaders leveled it to 
the ground. 

It was after Uncle Tersey had studied with Shakya Shri and traveled with Katok 
Situ-and after spending so many years away from home in faraway Central 
Tibet-that my grandmother decided to go searching for him. 



Part Two 

Early Years

My Childhood 

Let me explain a little about my immediate family. My father Chimey Dorje had 
five children with my mother. First was my sister Tsagah. I was next, and then 
came my brother Tenga. He was one year younger than I and had been recognized 
by the Drukchen as a rebirth of a fine master named Lama Arjam. He died when 
he was thirty-seven years old. Mter him came my sister Mingyur Chadron who 
died in 1989. Both sisters had children, some of whom are still living in Kham. My 
youngest brother was Kunzang Dorje. 

Kunzang Dorje was an astonishing human being and was supposedly an in-
carnation of Neten Chokling. m While still young he had shown many miracu-
lous signs. Early on, he gave clear predictions about the coming destruction of 
Buddhism in Tibet, which were recorded by a monk at Gebchak Gompa. Once 
he said that one of our relatives had died while on a pilgrimage around Mount 
Kailash-just at the time that it happened. He also knew that his own life would 
be very short. One day, when he was only fourteen years old, he told my mother, 
"Poor mother, I am very sorry that you will be so sad when my corpse is cremated:" 
He died later that year. 
. My father had two children with another woman, the eldest being Penjik. 
In addition he had a daughter and a son by two other women. The son, Kungo 
Kalsang, was born from a practitioner in Shakya Shri's camp. My father had been 
living at this encampment for a while when they got together. au 

My birth took place at Drakda, a small place on the way from Lhasa to Samye, 
situated near the Life-Lake of Ycshe Tsogyal. us 

As a newborn infant, I became severely ill with some unknown disease, and 
was at the brink of death. My parents took me to Samye monastery. At the Castle 
ofSamye was one of five sacred statues of Padmasambhava, which the Lotus-Born 



142 EARLY YEARS 

had said looked exactly like him. 124 The statue was placed inside a vase from which 
people could receive water as a blessing. By then 1 had actually stopped breathing. 
so there was little my parents could do but place me in front of the statue and pray 
to the Lotus-Born. 

My parents prayed that their newborn baby would not die-and later they said 
that it was because of Padmasambhava's blessings that I didn't. As they prayed. 
1 opened my eyes for the first time and started breathing again. After that, they 
brought me along to all the other pilgrimage places around Samye. Of course,! 
don't remember any of this, but my father told me the whole story. 

My father was very close to the eminent master Drukchen, so we went to his 
main seat by way of the Yarlung valley. us In the upper part of the valley was the 
practice center known as Joyful Cave where the accomplished master Shakya Shri 
resided, having been invited from Kham by the Drukchen. 

My parents told me that the eminent Drukchen was very kind to us. He also 
asked my father to perform rituals to support his health and long life. We stayed 
there for four or five months. So it was that I spent the first part of my life at the 
encampment of Shakya Shri. The Drukchen had special brocade garments made 
for me and my siblings; some of this brocade was made into a jacket that I wore 
until I left for Kham. 

My uncle and the Karmapa had a mutual teacher-disciple relationship, and at 
the time of my birth, my uncle Samten Gyatso was at Tsurphu, giving the New 
Treasures to the fifteenth Karmapa and receiving some transmissions as welL 
Since Sam ten Gyatso was the eldest of his brothers, my father sent him this mes-
sage, •A boy child has been born to me. Please ask the Karmapa, Khakyab Do~e. 
to give him a name:' 

So the Karmapa wrote my name-Karma Orgyen Tsewang Chokdrub Palbar-
in his own hand, mounted it on a piece of fine brocade, stamped it with his seal, 
and sent it to my parents accompanied by a white scarf and five yards of red 
Chinese brocade embroidered with golden thread. •Give this brocade to the boy; 
it is my present to him; the Karmapa said. Strangely enough, we never managed 
to make anything useful from that brocade. Since it was from the Karmapa, people 
regarded it as so special they didn't dare cut it up. 

It might seem improper for me to repeat this, but anyway, the Karmapa also 
said, ·The boy is a genuine tulku:' At the time, however, he didn't mention of whom 
I was a reincarnation. 



My Childhood 143 

Over the years, I lost the small scroll with my name on it several times, but I 
always found it again. The first time I lost it I was quite young. It appeared that a 
mouse had stolen it, because later when 1 was looking inside a mouse hole I found 
the scroll there. I lost it again while I was staying at my mother's house. Her family 
"'-as so wealthy that the pile of used tea leaves from all the people passing through 
"'-as big enough for us kids to play around in. One day, I noticed the scroll sitting 
on the neap of tea leaves. It was a bit discolored after sitting in the old tea but 
otherwise fine. I assume a mouse had carried it there, too. Now I keep it safely in 
my reliquary box. 

My parents and I stayed on in Central Tibet for a few years, where I picked 
up some of the Central Tibetan dialect and some of their songs as well. Then we 
began our slow return to Kham. My father had gone ahead to Drong Gompa-the 
monastery of Lama Tendzin Dorje, my son Chokyi Nyima's previous life-which 
is situated several days' journey north of Lhasa on the route to Kham. 

My family was gathering at Drong monastery before we began our journey home. 
Samten Gyatso had been there to confer empowerments for a whole month,>:l6 
Lama Tendzin Dorje was a very close friend of Uncle Tersey; they had a brotherly 
affection for each other and were both close disciples of the great master Shakya 
Shri. That was another reason Uncle Tersey hadn't returned lo Kham yet: he had 
b'een held up there at Drong for a year and now his mother, Konchok Paid ron, also 
~ided there, with Uncle Sang-Ngak as her attendant. My father had just arrived, 
and now-finally-everyone was supposed to journey together back to Kham. 

But before we left Central Tibet, the fifteenth Karmapa passed away. I had been 
taken to see the Karmapa when I was three years old, and I remember the area 
around Tsurphu, the temple hall and meeting many lamas, but being just a small 
Child at the time, I don't remember the Karmapa's face. At the time of his death, I 
~that an hour's walk from Tsurphu, there were some sand dunes, and people 
were weeping on both sides of the road. 

Right after this, we began our trip back to Kham. For a three-year old, the jour-
neywas a very long horse ride indeed; I rode along sitting in a basket hanging from 
the side of a horse. I remember once falling out of the basket and getting hurt. 

Back home in Nangchen, I stayed with my mother and was united with my old-
ersister.l spent the rest of the year there with them. Soon after that, my brother 
and I began learning the alphabet, tutored by a kind old lama. When I was finally 
able to read, I was taken to Gebchak monastery and continued my studies with my 
maternal uncle as tutor.

Dechen Ling 

About this time, we heard that my grandmother wanted to move to Tsikey. She 
said, •I want to drop my body at the monastery of my father and brothers. I refuse 
to die anywhere dse:O And, true to form, she wouldn't listen to anyone who tried 
to dissuade her. 

You know how a child can keep raising questions? I was like that as well-ex-
tremely curious, always asking impossible questions and twisting people's remarks 
around for no reason whatsoever. No matter who came, I would attack them with 
queries, interrogating them until they lost their power of speech. I was inquisi-
tive to an exacting degree, just like my grandson Phakchok, our present Tsikey 
Chokling's oldest son. 

Wangdor, an old lama, was very affectionate toward me and I barraged him too 
with one question after another: What is mind? What is its nature? How does one 
meditate? And I was particularly fond of bugging the old ladies in my mother's 
house. I would start out by asking, ·Where do earth and water come from? Who 
made them that way? How did the first water begin and in what direction did it 
flow? Why is the sky blue? How long has it been this way? Was it always blue? If 
not, how did it change?· 

They would become dumbfounded and say, •What an annoying child!• Finally, 
someone would ask, exasperated, ·can't someone else take care of this kid?'"

As a child I remember studying with a 
personal tutor and spending lots of time 
with my mother. She came from a wealthy 
family and had her own house connected 
to the main manor in Tsangsar Dranang. 
But when I was around nine, I was handed 
over to my father at his hermitage, a day's 
ride away. When I was eighteen, I went 
to Lachab Gompa, where Samten Gyatso 
took over my education. 

I had many homes. My family home 
was the Tsangsar estate-my father's origi· 
nal house, which was now run by my older 
brother Penjik- but my father's hermitage 
was home, too. I also had Lachab Gompa 



MyChildlzood 145 

with Samten Gyatso. In addition, I also regarded the hermitage Fortress Peak that 
belonged to Lachab as a home. 

My father's cousin, a sweet old lama, once teasingly said, •Maybe you are lucky 
that you can freely roam among your many homes, never staying long enough to 
be controlled by anyone-but maybe you11 turn into a spoiled brat. Watch out; 
you know the saying that an orphaned yak calf often starves to death, spending all 
its time going from teat to teat but never staying long enough to get any milk:" 

I was pretty free to go to any of my places every few months or so and was 
pampered whenever I arrived. But that all ended when Samten Gyatso got hold 
of me. 

One of my first tutors, who taught me reading and writing, was Gargey Lama. 
My brother Tenga and I both studied with him. He was a tulku and quite extraor-
dinary. When he was sweet, he was very sweet-but when he got angry, he would 
beat us. Nevertheless, he was very kind. 

Sometimes he seemed to have glimpses of clairvoyance; he made many predic-
tions. I remember him occasionally telling us small boys, •When I die, it won't be 
&om disease but from a gunshot:" 

Later, during the communist invasion, he went up the mountain and stayed in a 
cave. But sure enough, the Red Army found him, brought him down and shot him. 

Before continuing with my tale, I want to emphasize that the Dharma was re-
markably widespread throughout the snowy land of Tibet. It so permeated our 
society that even small children didn't have to deliberately study prayers such as 
the supplication to the Lotus-Born master. They would learn how to chant it just 
by growing up in this Buddhist environment and hearing it over and over. 

Children's games reflected this atmosphere and we often played at building 
monasteries. Groups of us kids would pile up mud and stones, under my super-
vision, and we managed to make some small •temples• in which we would play 
"'ama~ Sometimes these games went on from early morning until sunset. 

Aside from the hermits and vast assemblage of monks and nuns living in the 
big monasteries, practitioners often stayed together in large encampments, such 
as the group surrounding Shakya Shri. For instance, the seventh Karmapa nev-
er stayed long in one place but moved from one camp to another throughout 
Tibet.'17 Any offerings he received he would pass along on the spot to the local 
monasteries. 



146 EARLY YEARS 

The seventh Karmapa's close entourage consisted of at least one thousand 
monks, who followed along wherever the Karmapa went. The monks and atten-
dants with their horses and yaks were so numerous that not everybody could fit in 
one place. So they staggered their movements in groups of one hundred, camping 
at seven or more different places a day's travel apart, staying a day in each place. 

People camped in tiny meditation tents with a single pole, just big enough to sit 
in. The whole monastic community would stay in such tents, though the master's 
tent was typically larger. They were all required to keep the Kagyu tradition of four 
practice sessions a day, even while traveling. At a designated time, a bell would be 
rung and they would eat their meal together. 

As soon as the meal was completed, according to the tradition, they would 
recite the Kangyur, the Buddhist canon in one hundred large volumes. As they 
traveled along, walking in a line across a vast plain, younger monks would dis-
tribute separate pages to each of the hundred monks, collecting the pages as they 
finished. All together they could easily complete all one hundred volumes by the 
time they reached the next mountain range, each monk reciting just two or three 
pages from each volume. The whole encampment was so large that, when every-
one was together, the monks could recite the whole Kangyur in just an hour. The 
heap of their used tea leaves was often as tall as a man. 

The Karmapa's caravan was known as ·the great encampment that adorns the 
world; one of countless examples illustrating how deeply the Dharma was woven 
into our very existence. 

Nangchen, where I am from, was not known for its many learned masters. 
However, we had so many lamas and tokdens-full-time meditators who never cut 
their braided hair-that there was a tradition among laypeople to ask whichever of 
these they met for teachings on the nature of mind, and then train in and realize it: 
Previously, the famous master Tsoknyi and his disciple Tsang-Yang Gyamtso had 
given teachings on the nature of mind quite extensively throughout the land, and 
so this tradition had become ingrained in the culture. 

This tradition was particularly strong at the many nunneries in Nangchen. The 
nuns were perhaps not very learned as scholars, but they focused wholeheartedly 
on pith instructions. They would request teachings on the nature of mind from 
every single lama who visited the region. Whenever a young tulku arrived at a 
hermitage or nunnery, he would immediately be surrounded by twenty or thirty 
nuns and pressured into giving ·mind teachings; often for the first time in his 
life. This caused many a young tulku to break out in a sweat, as these nuns were 



My Childhood 147 

~own for asking very subtle questions. As soon as the lama was finished talking 
about the nature of mind, a barrage of questions would come, each more difficult 
than the last. 

One such tulku told me that he was in dire trouble finding the right answers. He 
soon found his back against the wall. But it wasn't just him; the nuns would do the 
same with everyone-that was their style. The solution was simple: you needed to 
have the authentic lineage of instruction, not just be a tulku or professor of phi-
losophy in name only. It often happened that if someone had been given the title 
of.tulku· at an early age, people would automatically assume that he could give 
mind teachings. This particular tulku said that he felt it was improper to refuse the 
nuns-but he probably would have done so had he known that their understand-
ing was better than his theory. 

This didn't happen only at the small practice centers; the largest of these nun-
neries, Gebchak Gompa, was filled with female meditators, and whenever a lama 
\isited they would ask for teachings. And if you took a walk around the country-
side near a nunnery, you would often see nuns sitting on big rocks or under trees, 
usually in groups of two or three, meditating. 

In Nangchen being a nun was synonymous with being a meditator. 

It was often the case that the sons in my mother's family were affirmed to be 
incarnations oflamas. The family's young incarnate lamas would sit in on ceremo-
nies done for the benefit of the living and the dead, and would receive gifts from 
the faithful. 

Even as a child I used to preside over such ceremonies, being regarded as both 
a tulku and the descendant of this important family. In addition, they brought me 
along when rituals were to be performed at people's houses so that extra dona-
tions could be collected. I believe that for a summer and a winter I was forced to sit 
in quite a number of rituals involving the peaceful and wrathful deities to secure 
a privileged rebirth for the recently deceased. I'm sorry to say I received my fair 
share of undeserved earnings this way. ua 

But these activities were brought to a halt when Sam ten Gyatso performed my 
enthronement ceremony and thereby established that I was a rebirth of the previ-
ous Chowang Tulku. 

When I was around nine years old, I was placed in my father's care. He was 
residing at the mountain hermitage Dechen Ling, a small nunnery surrounded by 



148 EARLY YEARS 

26. 
Dechen Ung 

retreat huts. I was very fond of my father's 
hermitage; the scenery and views were 
beautiful, and its history went back to our 
early forefathers. 

Darma \Vangchuk, one of the forefathers 
of our Barom Kagyu lineage, had estab-
lished two monastic seats, one in Central 
Tibet and one in Kham. These were re-
ferred to as the upper and lower seats. The 

lower was on the mountain known as Jewel Heap of Countless AH Syllables.'19 The 
name comes from a small mountain decorated with self-appeared AH syllables in 
untold numbers.'' 0 Self-appeared syllables are quite wondrous. You could see the 
syllable AH in almost one hundred different places on the rock. I personally saw at 
least forty or fifty of them on the cliff face. 

This was an immensely blessed place where many past masters of the Barom 
lineage had lived and displayed their miraculous powers. When Darma Wangchuk 
was living in a cave there, many disciples gathered around him and later they be-
came renowned as the "thirteen with super-knowledge, the thirteen who could run 
like horses, the thirteen who could fly like birds" and many other feats of accom-
plishment. They all had lived on the mountain where Dechen Ling was situated. 

Dechen Ling stands out in my memory. Most of the people I remember in 
Kham are from the area around that mountain. I probably spent eight years there, 
interspersed with short visits to Fortress Peak to be with Samten Gyatso. I even-
tually served as my father's nyerpa for a whole year until I graduated to shrine 
master and became responsible for making all the tormas.' '' I was able to serve 
my father well in this capacity as Konchok Paldron had taught me how to make 
the tormas for the New Treasures. 

Sometimes I went to Lachab to see Uncle Sang-Ngak. Later, when I was about 
fifteen years old, he came to stay at Dechen Ling. Uncle Sang-Ngak taught me how 
. to do the rituals for the New Treasures, including the tunes, the mudras, what texts 
to insert where, how to jump from place to place in certain liturgies and the like. 

Life at Dechen Ling was idyllic. The hillside ·was covered with huge juniper 

trees, and I remember it having mainly clear blue skies and lots of sunshine. But 
later, during the Cultural Revolution, all the trees were cut down.''~ 

At the top of the mountain, within walking distance, there was an image o! 
the Buddha of Boundless Light about three stories tall. The first Tsoknyi's guru, 
Chogyal Dorje, who was a contemporary of Chokgyur Lingpa, left distinct foot-
prints in the four directions of the mountain. 



My Clzildlwod 149 

Over the centuries, Dechen Ling had fallen into disrepair, and was restored 

by one of the lamas from Gebchak. My father settled down at this hermitage and 
spent many years in retreat until he left his body there approximately twenty years 
later. He lived there continuously, with one major interruption: when he went to 

Tsikey for the cremation ceremonies of his mother, Konchok Paldron. He made 
a few small visits on the way back, but otherwise he spent all his time there. It 
was while he was living there that the hermitage became known as Dechen Ling, 
which means the Sanctuary of Great Bliss. 

Directly below my father 's retreat house was a small nunnery belonging to 

Gebchak. During the twenty years that my father stayed at the hermitage, the 
number of nuns grew from half a dozen to around one hundred. When my father 

lived there, the nuns were poor but highly motivated. After my father's passing, 

the nuns all worked together to build a fine temple hall to replace the previous 
substandard one. Despite how nicely the temple was made, it was still leveled to 

the ground by the communists. My youngest son tells me that the temple has been 
rebuilt and there are again between eighty and ninety nuns. •n 

I remember some outstanding meditators living around Del:hen Ling. They did 
nothing but train in the natural state of mind, wearing only a simple sheepskin 

Coat and eating little more than tsampa flour and the occasional piece of dried 
meat Beneath them they had a few 
planks covered with a sheepskin, in 
front of them a small table, and below 

it one cup beside their bag of tsampa. 
People who make up their mind only 
to practice don't seem to need much. 

Among them was a nun living in a 
small shack; she had no possessions. 
This nun originally had been a disciple 
of my father's. While still quite young, 

she had walked all the way to Mount 
Kailash and back. I knew her personally 
and found her simplicity truly inspiring. 
She was the type of person you almost 
wouldn't notice in a shrine hall, typi-
callysitting near the door on the lowest 
seat and keeping her head down.

150 EARLY YEARS 

She was pretty unusual. She would do five hundred prostrations every day. At 
one point, she asked to have her door sealed up with mud and stones, something 
in Nangchen we call ·sealed retreat~ Only a small opening was left, just big enough 
to pass meals and provisions through. She stayed like that for one year and then 
unsealed the door. She would alternate like that from one year to the next. 

Normally, she didn't talk to anyone, and all you could hear was the soft mur· 
mur of her clear and melodious chants. Once, while passing through the area, the 
Chokling ofNeten stopped at her shack and stuck his head in the door. He wanted 
to check whether she was just a tenacious but stupid meditator. 

He called in to her, ·What are you doing in there? Are you hibernating like a lit· 
tle marmot? Trying to sit still for a long time, resting in a state of stale quietuder 

•No; she calmly replied, •I am sustaining the state of original mind, just letting 
be in uncontrived naturalness. This mind is empty and an emptiness that is empty 
by itself doesn't require me to do anything~ 

Once she had explained her practice to him, he felt there was nothing he need· 
ed to teach her. 

He later told me this story, remarking, •That was the most impressive old nun 
I have ever seen. She had nothing more than the bare essentials and darn fine 
practice!• 

She spent her life there, supported by various people. She was quite old by the 
time the communists came and she refused to leave, saying, •I am sure they will 
give me a hard time, but so what? I can take it• 

She was still a nun when she passed away. This old lady exemplifies one of the 
more resolute meditators-but most of the nuns there had an outstanding perse· 
verance. 

I remember three main aspects of my childhood: a strong desire to live in caves, 
practicing meditation and being a bit of a charlatan. 

When I was quite young, I had deep trust in two masters: Milarepa and 
Longchenpa. At times my devotion to them overwhelmed any other emotion. 
Sometimes when local people came to me in their traditional way to ask for bless· 
ings, I would say, •May Milarepa watch over you· or •May Longchenpa protect 
you~ I would even say this to my parents and Sam ten Gyatso when I wished them 
goodnight. 

As these two famous masters had spent a good part of their lives in caves, when 
I was six or seven I got the urge to be a serious cave dweller. I asked everyone I met 
if they knew where a cave might be found and searched them out. In this way, I 



My Childhood 151 

became familiar with all the caves in the area. My main wish was to move into one 
of them and devote myself to spiritual practice. 

I was also very fond of pitching small tents in the countryside with whomever 
\\'aS looking after me; we would spend whole days camping in the hills. Using our 
camp as a base, we would take long hikes to search out every cave in the area. 
Every time we found a cave, we would sit there very happily, expounding upon 
the virtues of cave dwelling. In particular, I remember a small but very interesting 
cave on the cliff rising above our house at Tsangsar. Every so often, I went up there 
and pretended to meditate, imitating the posture of a meditating hermit. I also 
practiced the meditation instructions I had heard from various lamas. 

Later on, another cave above my father's hermitage caught my attention. 
Interestingly enough, there was no access to it from below. The only way to enter 
was to lower yourself down the cliff by rope, which looked like a very difficult un-
dertaking. On an outcrop on the steep cliff was a big tree I used to climb out on to 
scout for access. Despite my keen anticipation, I never got into that cave. 

There was also a cave at Fortress Peak, right on the brink of the abyss. Generations 
before, people had hammered iron rings and carved footholds into the solid rock; 
the rings were then connected with ropes. It was said that there were many rep-
resentations of enlightened body, speech and mind inside the cave. To top it off, I 
was told that a local protector had gotten into the cave and was sometimes seen 
in the form of an enormous snake, preventing thieves from running off with the 
valuables. So through the centuries not one item had ever gone missing. 

Hearing all this, of course I had to get to that cave. I could see from across the 
vaUey that it was pretty large, but none of the images were visible. The shrine ap-
peared to have been walled up with stones and mud, so I imagined all the amazing 
stuff that would be found if we were able to excavate. 

One day, I asked Sam ten Gyatso ifl could attempt to climb down to it. •Absolutely 
not!" he said. ·No one can possibly reach that cave. It was once accessible long ago, 
but not nowadays-unless you can fly like a bird!• 

Nonetheless, having heard that the proper way to mountain climb was for the 
main person to have a rope tied around his waist, I gathered a group of young 
helpers to carry ropes that we would tie to a large juniper tree on the top of the 
cliff. I think my cousin, the young incarnation of Karmey Khenpo, was there along 
¥lith eight or nine others. Our plan was to excavate the treasures-serpent be 
damned-and then share the goods with my parents and Samten Gyatso. 

Each of us had a strong rope around our waist, and off we marched. We hadn't 
gotten far before a voice rang out behind us, ·Hey, you! Young lamas! Where are 
you going?" It was my aunt Tashi Chimey.

Peak from the 
road to Lachab 

"We're just walking over there; I said. 
"So, why do you need so many people to do that?" she inquired. 
"It's no big deal, we're just taking a walk; I said. 
She must have gotten worried, though, because she went and got Samten 

Gyatso, who came out after us. All he had to do was show his face and ask us what 
we were up to for us to abandon our plans and scatter. 

That cave lingered for quite a while in my hopes as a place I could hide away and 
practice; the objects inside weren't that important. But I never got in there. Last! 
heard, not even the Chinese invaders could overcome the formidable challenge of 
the sheer cliff and so the sacred images inside remain undisturbed. 

Toward the top of Fortress Peak was a place purported to be a cave where the 
Lotus-Born master had stayed. It looked more like an indentation with a rock 
overhang and barely had room for one person. Next to it was a VAJRA GURU man· 
tra ' 34 that had self-appeared on the cliff face. With the idea of making a cave I put 
a lot of effort into piling up rocks to build a wall around the indentation. Another 
tulku from Lachab had heard about something called "cement" and said he knew 
how to make it and offered to help. Over lunch at Fortress Peak, we had a very 
serious discussion about how to go about making it, but that plan never amounted 
to anything either. 

So in the end, unfortunately, I never did get to live in a cave, as all my time was 
taken up by my studies. 

I was so obsessed with cave dwelling that 
I fear my next life will be as a bug in a cave! 

Apart from my longing for caves, I was 
also fond of playing "meditator." My fa· 
ther and Samten Gyatso often taught the 
grown-ups how to meditate, and I had 
many chances to sit in and listen. Well, at 
least my ears were present; as I was a child 
at the time, I won't pretend to have under· 
stood all that they were saying. However, 
being young and inquisitive, I had heard 
something about a "mind nature" that 
could be recognized and trained in, as weD 



My Childhood 153 

as something about sitting quietly without doing anything. So I tried to imitate it, 
•meditating• on the mountainside around Dechen Ling. 

I also caught hold of the word semtri, which mean.'> •guidance in understanding 
and experiencing the nature of mind~ I used that word with great enthusiasm and, 
being of a talkative nature, pestered every single lama who came, forcing them to 
give me ·semtri~ I don't remember what they said in those early years, but as I got 
older I started to pay attention to their words and meaning. 

Apparently, there is always a need to have the nature of mind pointed out; even 
tulk'US don't seem to know it on their own. Some people think that the Karmapas 
have no need for the pointing-out instruction and can recognize mind nature 
by themselves. But with a sense of deep respect, the sixteenth Karmapa told me 
about the time he was given the mind transmission by the great Situ of Palpung, 
his devotion for this master was very deep. So the transmission of mind nature is 
definitely important; someone must always demonstrate it. 

In the life stories of masters, you often find that when they first received the 
pointing-out instruction and recognized mind essence, they experienced aware-
ness stripped bare of the veils of conceptual thoughts, revealing a state that is wide 
open like the sky. However, being an ordinary person, I didn't experience anything 
like that at all. Rather than an amazing or extraordinary experience, it was more a 
sense of being very simple and uncomplicated. I never had any spectacular experi-
ences such as swallowing the sky in one gulp. 

It is not only extraordinary meditation experiences that I have missed out on; I 
have also never had any unique visions or received any earth-shattering prophe-
cies about the future. Maybe it is my insensitivity-like a stone. As a matter of 
fact, I have never had any amazing experiences. However, from an early age, I was 
fond of acting like I was a meditator and, as I mentioned, I had a natural faith in 
Longchenpa and Milarepa. 

As I grew up, Samten Gyatso became my main meditation instructor. Though 
he was well aware that I was a small child and hence likely unable to comprehend 
all the teachings, he didn't hold anything back. I was about eleven when he clari-
fied the details of the principal teachings. 

Until then, my meditation was guided mainly by what felt right. As a child, 
I would go to nearby caves and ·meditate,· but what I experienced then as the 
meditation state and my practice right now seem to be exactly the same-don't 
ask me why. I must have had some habit of letting be in the natural state carried 
over from former lives. Yet in those early days, I wasn't that clear about what it 
was until Sam ten Gyatso instilled in me a certainty about the natural state. Up to 
that point, meditation experience had been more spontaneous, but with Sam ten 



154 EARLY YEARS 

Gyatso I could ask one question after another and I discovered that what he was 
explaining was the same as what I had experienced as a child. 

I don't have much to brag about in terms of realization, so the clarity I am 
talking about has more to do with demonstrating personal confidence. The faith 
and devotion I had as a kid were quite natural and not imposed on me by anyone: 
Along with my devotion, I also had an acute feeling that mundane aims were fu. 
tile. The only thing that made sense was to be a tough guy-tough like my heroes 
Milarepa and Longchenpa. 

When I look back on my life, it seems I haven't been very diligent; I have only 
been distracted day and night, letting life run out. 

When I was twelve I broke my right arm falling down a staircase, and a year or 
so later, I fell off a horse and broke the left one. The first time there was a problem 
with the bone and an old doctor was summoned all the way from Lachab. The 
problem was that the arm needed to be set and he was too soft-hearted to cause 
a child such intense pain. He just couldn't bring himself to do it. I started to scold 
him for not respecting my gutsiness, regarding me as a mere child. 

•rm the one who has to spend the rest of my life with a crooked arm!· I argued 
•so, give it a yank and be done with it!• He finally gave it the yank it needed and 
then bound it, Khampa style, with a splint. 

This still wasn't as bad as the following year, when the bone stuck out of my 
flesh. The accident happened way up on the mountain and it took me half a day 
to get back. Once again a doctor had to be sent for. There was a choice between a 
man who used to help repair the broken legs of cattle and an old geezer, a doctor 
who had been a disciple of the fifteenth Karmapa. The old one was sent for, but a$ 
he approached our place, his horse was startled and threw him. He was hurt quite 
badly and people thought he was dead. Around dusk, just as I managed to reach 
home, I ran into two guys carrying the injured doctor. 
. The old healer tried to direct his two assistants in setting my arm, but they 
weren't that brave. Again I had to take charge. ·wait a minute; I told them 
•Neither of you will feel the pain! And if you don't do it, I'm the one who11 be 
walking around with a crippled arm. So just do it!• 

•pull it! Pull it!• the old doctor yelled. 
Then I said, •you think you're being kind by protecting me from the pain? I 

think you're being cruel! You two are useless!• 
I began pulling my own arm into place. But I wasn't doing it right and the bone 

was sticking out at a funny angle. Finally, out of pity, they took over and aligned 



My Childhood 155 

the bone. They dressed the wound, but not that well-I was bedridden for two 
months with incredible pain. Lying there in bed, I could see the birds flying past 
my window. I often thought how happy they must have been to be able to fly and 
Wished I had been born a bird. Seeing the lambs and kid goats, I thought how 
luclcy they were to be healthy and not sick like me. The pain was continuous day 
and night, and so intense I couldn't sleep. For a long time I couldn't even lift that 
ann, but slowly it healed. 

At least in my early years I had some courage. 

Now for my short-lived stint as a charlatan. The first time I went to Gebchak, I 
was around five years old. In those days, just after dusk, I could ·see• things, as if in 
a dream. Sometimes I even believed I was having a vision of Buddha Shakyamuni. 
It was probably just a trick of the light, but I happily used these occurrences to my 
advantage. 

The nuns would treat this little pretender with great respect. Sometimes they 
would ask, •What practice are we doing?• And because of my •visions• I was able 
to teD them the name of their particular yidam and Dharma protector. When it 
turned out to be true, they were flabbergasted and prostrated before me. 

So the nuns began to treat me like a precious object. I even succeeded in fool-
ing the head nuns who lived near the abbot's quarters. When someone takes ad-
vantage of people simply because of a bit of clairvoyance or a few clear dreams, 
but doesn't yet have the substance to guide others-would you call that person 
anything other than a charlatan? 

I took delight in the nuns' wide-eyed amazement and devotion. As I grew older, 
this clairvoyant ability slowly faded. Though my career as a charlatan didn't last 
long. it was quite successful. 

So, when people talk about clairvoyant and miraculous powers I'm not that 
impressed. In fact I actually feel a certain distrust. 

I did have another stint as a charlatan again when I was a bit older. After I 
had gone to Dechen Ling to live with my father, he kindly taught me and I began 
to understand the scriptures. My father would sit outside under a huge tree on 
top of a large boulder and often teach me using the songs of Milarepa, half an 
hour at a time. He taught me many of the tunes and I grew very fond of them. 
My father had two distinct ways of singing those songs and I can still remember 
them clearly. 



156 EARLY YEARS 

Once when I made a trip back to Gebchak, the nuns there didn't know I had 
learned the songs by heart. One time, I remember sitting in a small cave, wrapped 
in a white flag to look like MUarepa, singing for forty or fifty nuns. You should 
have seen them-they were really impressed! I basked in their devotion. I was still 
a young kid, and when 1 went to pee, they would sometimes collect it and drink a 
handful, thinking I was Milarepa in person.

The Nunnery ofYoginis 

Tsang-Yang Gyamtso, the founder of Gebchak Gompa, had passed away long be-
fore my stay there as a child. Tsang-Yang Gyamtso had been born into an impor-
tant local family and was rich, powerful and quite arrogant. As a young man he 
had enjoyed hunting. In those days rifles could shoot only one bullet at a time. 
One day he saw a herd of deer in a valley. Taking aim he hit a fawn. Its mother 
turned toward him and, letting out a pleading cry, continued to guard the rest of 
the herd. 

As she stood there looking straight at him, Tsang-Yang began to have second 
thoughts, "Oh no! She knows I am going to kill her and yet she lingers there to save 
her fawn. I am a true murderer!" 

As he reflected on this a deep sense of self-loathing welled up within him. He 
flung down his rifle and smashed it with a large stone. Next he threw away his 
knives and daggers; unleashing his horse and yak, he set them free. At a villager's 
house along the way, Tsang-Yang told the owner where he had left his horse and 
ihat the man could have it. 

Then he set off on foot with only one thought in mind, "1 must meet Lama 
Tsoknyi!" 

At this time the first Tsoknyi was the lama at Nangchen palace's main temple. 
That morning Tsoknyi had told his attendant, "A man will probably come to meet 
me today, a stranger. Let me know the moment he arrives!" 

At mealtime, Tsoknyi asked, "Has anyone come yet?" 
The attendant replied, "No one special, just this frazzled, tired-out guy. I gave 

him some food and a place to rest. No one important has come, only him~ 
"That's the one!" exclaimed Tsoknyi. "I told you to notify me right away. Bring 

him up here immediately.·

Gebchak 

Gompa-the 
nunnery of 
meditators 

As soon as they met, Tsang-Yang Gyamtso said, "I have completely given up the 
aims of this life. Now my only goal is to practice the sacred Dharma from the core 
of my heart. Please accept me as your disciple~ 

"Very well; Tsoknyi replied. "If that's what you really want, you must start from 
the beginning. I will teach you only if you follow my instructions while you stay 
in retreat~ 

Tsang-Yang Gyamtso was then given a small hut on the hillside. It's still there; 
I've seen it myself. After a while Tsoknyi told him to stay in that hut and not come 
back for three years. Tsang-Yang readily accepted. Noble beings make faster prog-
ress than others during a three-year retreat. The story goes that after those three 
years, he had attained a very high level of realization."5 

Tsoknyi himself was an incarnation of Ratna Lingpa, one of the major revealers 
of terma treasures. ' ,6 I was recognized as an incarnation of Chowang Tulku, who 
was also one of the first Tsoknyi's disciples. 

Under Tsoknyi's guidance, Tsang-Yang Gyamtso became an eminent practitio-
ner. He was also very bold and intrepid. For example, once he traveled to the lower 
part of Kham to visit both Khyentse and Kongtrul. Upon meeting Kongtrul, he 
insisted on being given a complete set of the wonderful new collection of sacred 
scriptures that he heard Kongtrul was about to publish. Because of his audacious 
tenacity, Tsang-Yang was the first lama to receive a printed version of the Treasury 
of Precious Term as from Old Kongtrul himself. 



The Nunnery of Yogin is 159 

Tsang-Yang Gyamtso became an outstanding master, and had between five 
and six hundred disciples who showed signs of accomplishment. These disciples 
dtemselves had innumerable disciples who were able to benefit beings in countless 
ways-I personally met many of them. 

One day, Tsoknyi told Tsang-Yang, •your forte in benefiting beings lies in build· 
ingnunneries. Female practitioners are often not valued, and so they have a hard-
ertime finding proper guidance and instruction. Therefore, rather than keeping a 
Congregation of monks, you should take care of nuns. That is your mission:" 

Tsang-Yang followed Tsoknyi's command and built two major nunneries, one 
of which had thirteen retreat centers. His benefit for beings became broader than 
his master's. Most of the nuns practiced the revealed treasures of Ratna Lingpa, 
which include Hayagriva as well as the peaceful and wrathful deities. Each retreat 
center focused on a different cycle of these treasures. 

Tsang-Yang Gyamtso had his own opinion about how his large community of 
nuns should live. ·or course it would be wonderful to have a well-off monastery, 
but I pity monks and nuns who get so fat from donations given out of faith that 
ifter their death they plummet straight down and have no chance to rise back up 
from the lower realms. Honestly, what good does that do? Practicing meditation, 
on the other hand, doesn't require eating tasty dishes. It is much better if their 
families provide for each nun individually and they live on that fare, simple as it 
maybe. 

'Donations given directly to the nunnery we will keep for the community as a 
whole to be used at the annual drubchen ceremonies, when tulkus and lamas are 
invited to participate. Otherwise, people who dine on donations to a monastery 
ensure their own imprisonment in the lower realms. If one starts out building 
monasteries and nunneries with the aim of freedom and enlightenment, but ends 
up eating offerings to the Three Jewels, I feel it would be pointless:" 

Tsang-Yang stuck by his view and spent all the donations to the nunneries at the 
annual ceremonies. The rest of the year, the nuns had to get by on what they got 
from their families and seasonal begging tours. This actually worked out well; it 
~-as quite easy to obtain enough provisions in this way. At each retreat center, the 
fuel for the fire was provided by the main monastery, while the nuns could always 
get hot water from the big copper cauldron in each retreat center. But the nuns 
cooked their own dinner soup for themselves in small groups. 



160 EARLY YEARS 

Gebchak's main abbey had thirty-six connected nunneries. Some of these had 
as many as four or five hundred nuns each, while even the smallest had about 
seventy. On the other side of the valley was a gompa for male tokden meditators, 
literally, ·realized ones~ with their hair tied up on the top of their heads-many of 
whom actually were quite realized. But I noticed some of them covered up their 
lack of realization by putting on pretentious airs. 

Looking down through the valley, you could see at least twenty large stupas. 
This entire valley was unique, but you only realized how unique when a great mas-
ter was passing through. Then, as far as the eye could see, the landscape became 
a sea of red robes. Another time it became visible was once a year when the nuns 
would put up prayer flags by the thousands. When they were done and the wind 
blew, the entire mountain seemed to come alive. 

The main abbey was divided into two areas: the upper for full-time retreat, 
where visitors were prohibited, and a lower one where the rules weren't as strict 
The nuns here would go for alms during harvest, then carry their provisions back 
to share with the others. Near the main monastery were thirteen retreat centers, 
each named after the particular mandala of deities those nuns practiced. Twenty 
or thirty nuns lived in each center. 

The nuns' quarters had a few holes in the roof to let in some light, but no actual 
windows. It is remarkable how little light it takes to see quite dearly, even when 
there are douds in the sky. When it rained, the rough planks on the roof were laid 
over the openings, but still a few drops leaked through. I wouldn't say it was the 
most comfortable of places. 

Under the table inside each meditation box, the nuns would keep their bags of 
tsampa flour and pieces of dried meat to supplement the tea and soup. One of the 
younger nuns would serve the others. The nuns didn't need much, just supplies of 
tsampa, butter, and some dried meat and dried cheese-simple food, but enough 
to survive on. 

The head lama had made a rule that there should be no loud talking outside. 
The nuns could talk to one another in a low voice. But if they wanted to call some· 
one, they couldn't yell. They had to clap their hands and beckon the person with 
a wave. Even with so many nuns living on that mountainside, I always felt it was 
totally quiet. 

Each nun would sit in a little box about one square meter-only slightly larger 
than her. The boxes lined the walls, with a space in the middle, so that about sixteen 
nuns could reside in an average room. The program was to practice throughout day 
and night. Upon entering a practice center, a nun would take her seat in a box con-
taining a stuffed mat. After that there was no more lying down-not even to sleep! 



I visited these rooms, which were on 

average the size of my small living quar-
ters here at Nagi. Each room would have 
an altar with the representations of body, 
speech and mind. One or two of the se-
nior nuns would keep the schedule. In the 
early hours . before dawn, a gong would 
be rung. In the center of the room was a 
small hearth for keeping the teapot warm 

Tlte Nunnery ofYoginis 

and, sometimes, the soup. There was no fixed duration for this kind of retreat, but 
many nuns would stay for life. 

The nuns' simple way of practice deeply impressed me. I felt it would be a 

meaningful way to spend one's life. 

While the nuns' retreat approach is known as drubdra, sadhana retreat-focus-
ing on yidam practice and mantra recitation-there is another style of intensive 
group practice called gomdra, meditation retreat.m In meditation retreat, people 
often sit outside, not in one continuous stretch from morning to evening but with 
the day divided into sessions. Once, the Chokling of Tsikey was invited to the 
famous Dzogchen monastery near Derge, where there was such a meditation re-
treat. My father, Chimey Dorje, went with Tsikey Chokling as his attendant. 
~· In that gomdra there were about sixty meditators, all practicing outside, sitting 
in rows of five or six with their backs straight. Both behind and in front of their 
heads, at a level just below their necks, were strands of thin thread suspended be-
tween two poles. During the actual sessions, their bodies were not to move even 
one inch. Their minds were supposed to remain in the state of non dual awareness. 
If the meditators fell asleep and their heads moved either forward or backward, 
!he thread would break. At that point, the retreat disciplinarian would come and 
reprimand them, "Hey, you broke the thread!" 

The meditators were also not supposed to move their eyes. For beginners, it 
was difficult not to blink, but eventually they could remain without moving their 
:erelids. To ensure that the meditators were actually doing this, the disciplinarian 
:would sometimes put red sindhura powder below their eyelids. If anyone blinked, 
then some red powder would stick on their eyelashes-evidence that they had 
blinked.

When I was a bit older, I returned with my father to Gebchak when he w2s 
invited to teach a group of two hundred nuns who were quite adept at yoga. 
Whenever he taught there, in the evenings his room was always packed with fifty 
or more nuns asking additional questions. 

Many of these nuns displayed signs of accomplishment, such as the inner heat 
of tummo. Once a year, on the night of the full moon of the twelfth month of the 
Tibetan calendar, there was a special occasion to show their mastery in the tummo 
practice of inner heat called ·the wet sheet:' In the eight directions around the 
practice center, nuns lit fires to melt snow where the sheets would be soaked. At 
this time of year it was so cold the wet sheets would instantly freeze upon being 
pulled from the cauldron. Despite the bitter cold, many local people would come 
to witness the ceremony, often bringing their children along as well. 

The nuns were naked underneath the large sheets, except for short pants. I for. 
get if they were wearing boots or not; they may have been barefoot. Those without 
any tummo experience found the cold almost unbearable; they would get stiff legs 
and frozen toes as the night wore on. For ordinary people it was virtually impos-
sible to take even a few steps wearing only shorts, let alone a wet sheet. 

The nuns began at midnight by singing the beautiful melody of supplicatio1 
while walking one full circumambulation of the monastery complex covering tht 
hillside, which was quite a long distance. The nuns wearing the sheets would w-J 
slowly during the song. They were singing and asking for the blessings ofTsoknt\ 
Tsang-Yang and the other masters of the lineage, as they continued to circumam: 
bulate until dawn. They begin at midnight, at first the sheets are not soaked; tht 
nuns merely walk while practicing tum mo. 

Halfway through the night, their sheets are lightly moistened from the wateria. 
the cauldrons and you begin to see a wisp of vapor from the heat of their tumnn • 
Then the time would come to completely soak their sheets, immersing them frl 
longer in the cauldrons. Sometimes the vapor from the line of nuns would l:t 
like a bank of mist drifting down the mountain. You could see beads of sweat a~ 
their bodies while the rest of us were standing there shivering. I saw this with~ 
own eyes several times. There were about eight hundred nuns participating. <X 
these, around two hundred had some degree of mastery in tummo; only the~ 
nuns would soak their sheets in the water cauldrons.'1' 

It is incredibly inspiring and moving to watch such a procession and I haven\ 
heard of this happening on such a scale anywhere else in Tibet or Kham. Those 
nuns were quite impressive. Upon passing away, a great many of them remain5 
in samadhi and some even left relics in their ashes. 

I feel that this is one story people should definitely hear.

Receiving My First Teachings 

lremember receiving my first formal teaching while still a child. It was the cycle 
on peaceful and wrathful deities revealed by Karma Lingpa, a teaching I had had a 
deep yearning to receive. I pushed very hard for this teaching and finally obtained 
it from my father when an old lama from Gebchak requested it. 

When the empowerment was postponed for just one day, I was very upset and, 
someone told me later, I looked extremely displeased. When the ceremony finally 
began. I joined in enthusiastically, even to the point of pushing and shoving in the 
traditional Tibetan manner when people stand up to be blessed with the imple-
ments.'" 

Following that, I often listened in when my father gave empowerments and 
instructions. But it was only from the age of fifteen that I began to take serious 
note of what I had received. I began the curriculum of large collections of scripture 
beginning with the reading my father gave at Dechen Ling of the Kangyur-the 
recorded teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni, which we respectfully call The Great 
Translated Words of the Victorious One. 
' Soon after, my brother Tenga invited the master Kyungtrul Rinpoche to the 
temple at our family home to give the Treasury of Oral Instructions. This was 
Do small gathering, and many tulkus and lamas attended the transmission, 
which lasted for three straight months. In between, another master gave the 
reading of the collected works of the first Kongtrul as well as the Treasury of 
Knowledge. •• 

During the yearly rituals of Kilaya at Dechen Ling, I learned to chant the Secret 
f.ssence Kilaya by heart; I still remember it to this day. At Dechen Ling, I partici-
pated in the yearly rituals of exorcism based on Vajra Kilaya. ••• 

My older brother Penjik had a small kilaya dagger that was reputedly. not forged 
by human hands and regarded as so special it was placed on the shrine during 
these ceremonies. A ritual dagger is placed vertically on a stand and decorated 



164 EARLY YEARS 

with a scarf. Once, the scarf somehow got stuck to the torma tray that was to be 
hurled out at the end of the exorcism. My friend who threw the torma obviously 
hadn't noticed this and the tray was thrown down the hill. 

When we tried to find the dagger, we were too late-a large raven had just flown 
off with the scarf in its beak. We knew how precious that dagger was and at first 
we were too scared even to mention it. We kept looking for it over the next several 
days before finally telling Penjik. But he was a true gentleman and said, "lt11 be all 
right. Let's just keep looking for it:' 

Under my father's supervision, I began the traditional preliminary practices 
of the four times one hundred thousand, which I completed as best a child can. 
The text I used is part of the Tukdrub cycle of terma revelations. I probably 
didn't do the practices very correctly, since I was only about eleven years old at 
the time. 

As a teenager, I also went through the pretense of going into strict retreat sev· 
eral times. For two months I did the Secret Essence Kilaya, in which I had great 
trust, professing that it was to prolong my father's life. I believed it, too, and made 
the elaborate tormas that dispel hindrances to longevity-but this was just the 
play of a child. 

During my early years at Dechen Ling, there lived an old lady who was a healer 
in the ancient tradition of herbal medicine. She possessed knowledge of some rare 
and secret concoctions that I should probably have learned. But I never did-and 
it was actually her fault. She was a seasoned meditator but would often blame the 
art of healing for all the clients who came to see her. 

"There is nothing worse than healing. I am an old woman, almost on the verge 
of death, and these sick people never leave me alone; she would lament. "It's all the 
fault of being a doctor. If I refuse, everybody will hate me. Of course no one but 
me is to blame, for when I had the chance to choose, I thought it would be useful 
to learn the art of healing. But now it is too late-there is no greater obstacle for a 
practitioner than being a doctor." 

Since I was young, I didn't realize she was just feigning the inability to be both a 
meditator and healer, and I believed all that she said. So I didn't take advantage of 
this opportunity to learn medicine. I may not be very bright, but I felt that I could 
have learned at least a little about medicine. 

This old lady was extremely skilled and cured one person after another. I knew 
of only one other person who held the same lineage as the old lady-a famous 
doctor in Nangchen. He later died at the hands of the communists and now it 



Receiving My First Teadtings 165 

appears that this lineage has died out. I hear that the text still exists, but that is 
not enough. The recipes and the hands-on experience of preparing the medicines 
must be passed on from one person to the next. 

The special recipes of their lineage originated from a healer named Tendzin 
Rabgye, an accomplished master from one of the old temples of the Barom Kagyu. 
These recipes were connected with one of the twenty-one genyen-guardian spir-
its of the Dharma who, when Padmasambhava was in Tibet, were bound under 
oath to protect the Buddha's teachings. 

This particular guardian resided in the Kechu River and came before the healer 
to tell him about eighteen new diseases that would afflict future generations. The 
guardian gave the master the instructions on how to cure them, saying, •you must 
keep them as a secret lineage taught to only one person at a time. Don't squander 
them." 

Tendzin Rabgye wrote the recipes down and taught them to his most important 
disciples. It was unfortunate that Kongtrul didn't receive these recipes because he 
would have made sure that their use spread. Instead they perished in the remote 
valle-,-s of my homeland. 

The old lady told me the particular locations where the different medicines 
grew, as well as the specific time of year they should be picked. It was all very 
precise and complicated. For instance, she knew a mixture of nine flowers that 
rould cure a particular fatal disease that involved swelling from water retention 
and, most likely, kidney failure. Another medicine had twenty-five ingredients, the 
met combination of which was very effective for healing boils and sores within 
afewdays. Some of her methods involved touching a particular spot on the body 
with a warm piece of metal. 

I wouldn't be surprised if one of the eighteen maladies these medicines treated 
was cancer-in fact, I am pretty sure this is so, as it is one of the newer illnesses 
of our times. Although the text still survives in the hands of one person from 
Nangchen, the oral lineage is vital. 

Isn't it a shame that such a lineage has been broken?

An Extraordinary Speech 

My half-brother Penjik was supposed to be a tulku, but he didn't want to be 
recognized as such. He was incredibly bright. Personally, I haven't met anyone 
as sharp as he was. For example, in a single day he memorized the entire text of 
Chanting the Names of Manjushri. 142 Think about that! Isn't it astounding? That's 
the kind of person he was. I certainly was in awe of him. 

If he had gone to Derge to pursue Buddhist studies, there is no doubt that he 
would have become a great scholar. Everything he heard, he understood. It's a 
shame he didn't stick to a spiritual path. 

Penjik was very brave and intelligent; no one could outdo him or dominate 
him in anyway. If you heard his full story, you would be in awe. Let's begin with 
his mundane qualities: He was extremely eloquent- so much so that he could be 
mistaken for a demon. 14 , 

Penjik was known throughout Nangchen for his bravery; he was completely 
fearless and not intimidated by anyone. He was also tall and broad-shouldered. 
You should have seen him race his horse or shoot his rifle while riding! He was an 
excellent marksman. I felt that he had all the important qualities of a hero. 

According to tradition when a Nang· 
chen king takes a queen, the suitable 
match is a princess from a neighboring 
kingdom, often Derge. When the cur· 
rent king married, guests were invited 
from all over the two countries. As was 
the custom someone from each side 
must stand up during the ceremony and 
give an impressive speech mentioning 



An Extraordinary Speech 167 

die royal ancestors, the history of the kingdoms and so forth. A very fine monk 
v.-as chosen, who spent three months trying to memorize the names of all the past 
kings. 

For his part Penjik was appointed the task of giving a particular speech compar-
ing the new queen's beauty with divine turquoise and the arrow of longevity. 

It was no coincidence that Penjik was chosen for this occasion. Many years ear-
lier, at a· wedding in Nangchen, he had given the traditional toast so impressively 
that the name Tsangsar Penjik spread far and wide as an orator of renown. He was 
OOly in his late teens at that time; by this time he was in his late twenties. 

Yet when he received the request Penjik rode a full day to come and tell my 
&ther he wouldn't give the speech. But my father told him, •you can't refuse. You 
ba\'e the intelligence and knowledge, so you must speak. You should respect why 
they chose you. When people have placed their hopes in you, it's not right to dis-
appoint them." 

At this time the Derge king had four gurus to bestow empowerments on him.144 
The holders of these four roles have changed over the course of history, but there 
were always supposed to be four gurus for the king of Derge. These four were 
prominent among those assembled at the Derge royal palace, including the nobil-
ity of the kingdom, their families and the eighty district governors. 

For the first ceremony, in which an official request for marriage is made for the 
priricess, a group of sixty officials were sent as delegates from the Nangchen court, 
with Penjik at their head. I won't burden you with all their names, but one of them 
said to Penjik, ·Tomorrow, you need to give the speech. Wouldn't it be better if 
JOU did a rehearsal now?• 

•If I prepare what I am going to say; Penjik replied, •z wouldn't be a real 
N~gchen man. There is no way I am going to embarrass myself with such artifi-
cial preparation." 

He did, however, have a little notebook containing some notes written by 
aiokgyur Lingpa's private secretary, Perna Yeshe, which someone had by chance 
hahded to him on the way to Derge. Since his friend continued to pester him, 
Penjik did read through it once or twice on the road. That was all it took for him 
to 'know the whole thing by heart. 

The next morning, the party went before the king. Penjik was ready to praise 
~princess, and his friend, after three months of preparation, was ready to praise 
the king, the royal ancestors, the virtues of the kingdom, and the skill and ingenu-
iyofthe citizens. At least that was what was supposed to happen. 

At this gathering, with everyone in their finest brocade, Penjik himself had on 
iiur or five brocade robes, one on top of another to look his finest, Khampa style.

32. 
The Situ of 

Palpung 

EARLY YEARS 

Inside the huge assembly hall, everyone was asked to take a seat on the elevated 
platforms, tea was served and then Penjik was signaled: it was time for the "tur· 
quoise and arrow· speech to begin. An ornate arrow with silken streamers was 
brought before Penjik and planted in a large vessel of rice. 

The people ofNangchen are a bit simple-minded 
and as no one was in charge of the delegates, none 
of them knew where to sit. Many of his companions 
were still lingering by the door and Penjik was left 
to his own devices. But a Chinese delegate gestured 
to Penjik to begin even before all the Nangchen of· 
ficials had been seated, so he stood up on his seat 
and began giving his speech. 

Penjik noticed the great Situ looking down at him 
from a lofty throne and felt his heart freeze. Penjik 
later said, "Now, that was a lama with majestic pres· 
ence! But the spell only lasted a second. Next I com· 

posed myself by thinking, 'Huh! The great Situ of Palpung or not, he's still only 
a human being made of flesh and blood. And I am also a human being- so why 
should I be afraid of him?' As I felt courage welling up inside me, I got annoyed at 
myself for having lost my nerve for a moment and began the speech:' 

Other people who were there later told me that his speech was more far-reach· 
ing than any they had heard before. It was precise and unbroken. Penjik started 
with how the world was formed and how the first sentient beings took birth in 
samsara, covering in great detail how the world had come to its present state. He 
followed that with a long comparison of historical links between Nangchen and 
Derge and how the kings were like brothers, and the entire background for the 
Derge king's lineage. Then he gave a similar explanation of the Nangchen kings, 
leading to the present occasion of joining the two families in matrimony-the rea· 
son everyone was there-comparing it with the union of means and knowledge to 

· benefit the Buddha's teachings and all sentient beings. 
As if that weren't enough, he went on to explain the difference between ordi· 

nary worldly rulers and Dharma kings, emphasizing that the monarchs of both 
countries were dharmaraja, religious rulers, which made this an extraordinary 
occasion. He then went straight into the "turquoise and arrow• speech, but not 
only did he employ the metaphors of the turquoise and arrow, but he expanded 
to include the entire setting of the Derge temple hall in Lhundrub Teng, known 
as the Palace of Spontaneous Perfection, bringing in the thousand-spoked golden 
wheel on the ceiling above and the eight auspicious emblems in the various direc· 



An Extraordinary Speech 169 

lions, while pointing to them with the arrow and making the silken streamers 
Hutter dramatically in the air. 

At some point, everyone started to smile and then began to laugh, because he 
had already poured out everyone else's speech. They were all pretty happy though, 
which was of prime importance because in the past physical fights or even dip· 
bmatic incidents would break out if one side hadn't been praised sufficiently by 
lhe oth-er. To tell the truth, instead of a happy marriage party, the danger always 
loomed that a one·sided speech could be the cause for a real fight to begin. But 
Penjik had covered all the bases. 

The four gurus each gave him a big white scarf and chanted their good wishes. 
Penjik looked up at the great Situ again and this time he was smiling. 

That afternoon there was a private meeting between the organizers. Someone 
stood up and said, •Tomorrow we are supposed to continue with the speech about 
lhe royal lineages:' 

Then the great Situ of Palpung said, ·sut this guy has already said everything 
there is to say! None of us can give a better or more detailed speech. Unless it is 
better than the speech he gave this morning, we can't outdo him. So, let's just skip 
lhe royal lineage speeches tomorrow:' The others agreed. 

That's why Penjik ended up being the only speaker. He was that kind of man. 
Afterward people were heard saying things like, •That was such a lengthy 

speech I wouldn't have been able to learn it by heart:' 
1 wanted to see the cue cards that Penjik must have hidden up his sleeve; 

mmeone else mentioned. •1 went over to check, but there weren't any:' 
It seemed there was another side to the whole story. 
Later, I heard our father say, •From early that morning and through the entire 

day, I sat alone under that tree over there continuously visualizing myself as Four· 
·Armed Mahakala. Upon the curved knife I had brought, I had attached a small 
pbque with Penjik's name on it as a way to increase his majestic presence:' 

True to the Khampa spirit, Penjik was always ready to ride into battle if need be. 
'Everyone has to die; it's just a matter of time-there's no doubt; he would say. •A 
good son must be a brave warrior. And a warrior must fight his enemies to protect 
his friends and family. If one dies doing this, so be it! It has to happen anyway. I am 
not afraid and I have no regrets:' Just the same, fearless though he was, when the 
communists came, Penjik was caught by the Red Army and killed in prison.

My Previous Life 

I must have been around thirteen years old when I heard that Shakya Shri's son. 
Sey Phakchok,'45 was living at a particular hermitage. Sey Phakchok was also one 
of my father's own teachers and I had often heard him mentioned with a lot of 
respect. He was a great master, similar to his father. 

At one point, my yearning to go there was so strong that I almost couldn't 
sit still. I began forming plans to run away from home. I came up with all kinds 
of subterfuges, but finally decided there was no way I could avoid telling my fa-
ther. My only problem was choosing a trustworthy confidant. I was still living at 
Dechen Ling at the time, but I finally chose a monk from a nearby monastery who 
was two years older. 

He said, •It will be hard for us to leave and your father will be very displeased.' 
·we'll tell him just as we're about to leave: I replied. 
The day came when we were all packed and ready to go, and I went to my father 

and told him I was leaving. He asked me where I was planning to go. 
·vou have told me so often of the greatness of Shakya Shri and his amazing son. 

Sey Phakchok, that I want to go and stay with him!• 
My father replied, ·sure, he is a great teacher, but you're too young to go. If you 

insist, I'll arrange a proper escort for you with supplies and pack animals-but nit 
. this year. Absolutely not:' 

This took the wind out of my sails. •Anyway,• my father continued, •you just 
need to make sure that Samten Gyatso knows beforehand. He is my older brother 
and has the final say:' 

However, the next year passed and I never ended up going, for Samten Gyatso 
took over my education soon after. By then 1 had been recognized as a rebirth d 
Chowang Tulku, an old lama from Samten Gyatso's monastery. 



Atfy Previous Life 171 

Here is how it happened. The sixteenth Karmapa, Rigpey Dorje, had confirmed 
in writing that my present rebirth was the continuation of the mind-stream of 
010 .... -ang Tulku. 1 don't know how great a lama ChOwang Tulku was, but he 
had spent many years up at Fortress Peak performing longevity rituals for the 
Nangchen king, a duty he shared with his brother, who was Sam ten Gyatso's pre-
rious incarnation. At some point, I was sent to stay with Sam ten Gyatso, who then 
gave me-the title Chowang Tulku, and I became a follower of my uncle. 

This meant sharing responsibility for the same monastery and retreat centers. I 
guess I was around seventeen or eighteen at the time. After 1 got locked into that 
situation, it was very hard to get away, for Samten Gyatso was not as lenient as 
my father. On the contrary, he was firm and steadfast, and whatever he said had 
~be obeyed. 

Once Samten Gyatso's former incarnation saw that his brother was an incar-
aation of Guru ChOwang, one of the five most important tertons. According to 
(l!Owang Tulku's own visions, he was also an emanation of Sangye Yeshe of Nub, 
~ofPadmasambhava's twenty-five disciples. As ChOwang Tulku said, •It's viv-
~ clear in my memory-so clear that I can never forget my former life as the 
Nubchen master~ 
·:· ChOwang Tulku apparently began practice at an early age, and they say that he 
~a meditator with a profound level of practice.'46 During the latter part of his 
)re at Fortress Peak, he used his time wisely, proceeding into a phase of unelabo-
,ratepractice where he simply sat and didn't do much other than meditation train-
·ing. I heard from people who had met him that he was quite corpulent and had a 
bng braid tied around his big head. 

The Treasury of Precious Termas was being assembled during Chowang Tulku's 
ife, and upon hearing of this treasury of teachings, he had the deep yearning to 
recei\'e it Eventually he received it from Lama Latsey, who was one of Karmey 
Khenpo's disciples and a very important holder of the monastic precepts in Kham. 
hwas an unusual transmission because there were only the two of them present-
master and recipient-for the entire Treasury of Precious Termas, which took six 
months. Only two attendants were permitted, to help with the shrine affairs. It 
took place at a remote hermitage where they locked the gate so that no one could 
mit 
.h sounds as if Chowang Tulku was a bit eccentric. He ardently collected the 

· F~ Treasuries of Kongtrul, paying to have them transferred into his custody. '47 
Apart from this expenditure, he would hoard all his many donations, which in-
cluded precious coral, turquoise and other valuables. Then once a year, he would 
have them all packed up and shipped off with one sentence, •Give these to my

guru, he knows how to use this stuff to promote the Dharma. Me, I can't do any-
thing with it:" 

In this way, his storeroom was completely emptied once a year, with nothing 
left behind. His own attendant told me this with a mixture of admiration andre-
gret, adding, ·As a matter of fact, for half of his life, he didn't do anything at all~ 

Chowang simply led the life of a hidden yogi. But apparently he had clairvoyant 
powers, and now and then he let a prediction slip out. Once his attendant, Kalpa, 
wanted to demolish part of the hermitage and build an expansive new structure. 
But Chowang Tulku said, ·oon't build anything!• Then, as if reading from a page, 
he added, ·In the future, a lama will come who will expand this place and if we 
build anything now, he will demolish it anyway. So don't trouble yourself.' 

This same old servant also told me the following story. 
One day, Chowang saw that his attendant was about to build a little workshop 

for tsa-tsa clay statuettes on a certain spot and told him, ·oon't build it there, be-
cause one day you will have to move it:" 

His attendant asked him, ·why, Rinpoche? There's lots of space around here.' 
·No, no; Chowang replied, •tater on Lama Tulku will build a large house here.' 

Chowang always referred to his brother, the third Ngaktrin Tulku, as Lama Tulku 
and never used his real name. 

This turned out to be true: Many years later, his brother's reincarnation, Samten 
Gyatso, built his hermitage, Sanctuary of Lotus Light, on that very spot. 

Kalpa, Chowang's attendant, was quite old when I met him. He had continued 
his meditation practice, and it seemed to me that he had reached a solid level of 
experience and realization. Kalpa told me many other interesting stories about 
Chowang. They must be true because that old monk never lied. 

Tsang-Yang Gyamtso once went up to meet Chowang Tulku and when Kalpa 
went in to announce his arrival, Chowang simply said, ·He doesn't need to see me. 

There's nothing he can get from meeting 
me:" So, the visitor did several circumam· 
bulations and left. 

ChOwang Tulku ............. . 

Another time, a guest who had trav· 
eled quite far came with an offering he 
had been given to present to Chowang 
Tulku:-a large brick of expensive Chinese 



My Previous Life 173 

tea. Halfway to Fortress Peak this guest stopped at a river to have a meal and, as he 
looked at the fine tea, decided to steal half of it. 

So he took out his knife and cut it in two. He wrapped one part back up in the 
white scarf and the rest he hid in his bag, thinking to himself, ·The lama doesn't 
need more than half, so I'll just keep the rest:' 

When he approached Chowang Tulku, the guest of course didn't mention any-
thing about taking some of the tea. As he handed over his offering of tea, he simply 
said, "This is for you:' 

Then he noticed that his knife, which he was especially fond of, was missing. 
Sohesaid, •Hey, Rinpoche! Could you perform a divination to see if I will find my 
favorite knife? I lost it somewhere on the way here:' 

Without a moment's hesitation, Chowang Tulku replied, ·oon't you remember 
v.itere we divided up the tea, half for you and half for me? Go back and you will 
find your knife lying right there:' 

Hearing this, the man was petrified and began to cry. He apologized, confessing 
the whole story. Weeping, he prostrated and took out the tea he had stolen. 

Chiiwang Tulku said, ·oon't take it so hard! I don't need that much tea. It's fine 
if you take some home. Take it back there and make yourself some delicious tea. 
Injoy it-and tell your family that I gave it to you:' 

In the kingdom of Nangchen lived Yonga, a realized master and close disciple 
of Old Khyentse. You could even say he was a siddha. One day he decided to 
go pay Chowang a visit at Fortress Peak. Chowang's bed, where he sat day and 
night, was a meditation box, a wooden frame with sides about one foot high all 
around. Chowang usually never stood up when visitors came, but this time he 
did. 

He told Kalpa, ·Put the yak skin over there; and to Yonga he said, ·sit:' 
YOnga later recounted, •He did come outside to greet me, which was a marvel-

oosfeat in itself; but that was it. After we sat down, he didn't say a single word to 
me. He just sat there, upright and still:' 

YOnga must have dozed off while sitting there, because when he was leaving he 
said to Kalpa, •I got what I came for, so I'm going home now. I came all the way 
from Nangchen Gar because I wanted to meet Chowang. I had a good nap. It's 
been a very pleasant visit:' 

Then he headed off.

lachab 

monastery 

In the latter part of his life, Chowang Tulku stopped talking almost completely. 
One day. it appeared that he was having some trouble walking, but when asked he 
would say, "I'm fine! I'm not sick at all." 

That evening, he and Kalpa took a short stroll to a small crest where an ancient 
stupa containing the sacred remains of one of the forefathers of the Sakya lineage 
is located. The siddha who had established Fortress Peak had been a disciple of this 
Sakya master and when his teacher passed away, the siddha flew through the sky 
carrying some of the remains back to Kham. He built the stupa in order to protect 

against obstacles. ' 41 

After ChOwang Tulku had walked around it four or five times, he had a hard 

time walking back inside. Kalpa thought, "If the master is having trouble walking. 

why did he go to the trouble of going around the stupa?" 
Early the next morning, Chowang Tulku said, "Don't forget to arrange the 

shrine. It must be done before the first rays of the sun light up the sky from behind 

the eastern mountains~ 
"I can already see the first rays of dawn; Kalpa told his master. At that, Chowang 

Tulku did the yogic practice of exhaling the breath three times. His third long ex· 
halation was his last. 

"I was suddenly panic-stricken; Kalpa later told me, "and began to run around 

confused. Until then, only the two of us had resided at Fortress Peak; now there V.'aS 



My Previous Life 175 

only me, and I didn't know what do! I ran down to the mountainside toward the near-
rst\illage and yelled at the top of my voice so that the people could hear me. Some of 
the locals came running up, and I yelled, 'Our guru's dead! Our guru's dead!' 

•Before the master left his body; Kalpa continued, •he gave written instructions 
to leave it untouched for a week. The document read, 'Send a message to Lama 
Latsey, from whom I received the Treasury of Precious Termas, and invite him 
1m: 

·With the long braid still coiled around his head, his body continued to sit, 
much as Chowang had done for most of his life. We sent for Lama Latsey. As he 
&ved three days' journey away, about six days later he was seen riding up the trail 
in the early morning. Telling him about the letter, I assured him I had kept the 
room locked until he had gotten there, so no one had disturbed the body. 

·When he entered Chowang Tulku's room, he saw the body sitting up straight, 
)1st as if nothing at all had happened. He counted the days and he said, 'According 
to the letter, we must leave the body as it is for one more day: 

•5o we left the room and the door was again locked. Lama Latsey then said, 
'WelL there are some things we need to get done. First, arrange for someone to 
begin building the funeral stupa, and send someone to invite fifty or sixty lamas 
md monks from Lachab Gompa: 

·an the morning of the eighth day, we went back into the master's room and 
discovered that the body had shrunk quite a bit. By the time it was placed inside 
lbe funeral stupa, it was barely eighteen inches tall, but it still retained human 
proportions. It fit in a copper pot and was easy to put inside the stupa. The braid, 
bJwever, didn't shrink and practically covered the remains. We then cremated this 
small body .• '49 

So that's the type of lama they say I'm the rebirth of. Whether it is true or not, 
I don't know. But it was Samten Gyatso who settled that it was so, and then he 
took charge of my life and education. For a while I moved back and forth between 
iachab and my father's hermitage in order to spend time with him. Before this, I 
don't remember having stayed a full year in any one place. 

In those days, I did some short retreats lasting a couple of months here and a 
muple of months there, but none of any significant length, except for a six-month 
Ita}' at Fortress Peak in something resembling a retreat. It was only when I went 
to Tsurphu that I got the chance and freedom to dedicate myself to a strict three-
J!W retreat. 

It seems I have spent my entire life moving from place to place. 



20 

My Monastery 
and Enthronement 

Samten Gyatso and I shared the same monastic household at Lachab; my aunt 
Tashi Chimey acted as the manager. Many of the important shrine objects would 
be with me today if it hadn't been for her refusing to let me take them with me 
when I later went to Central Tibet. She said that they belonged to the monastery 
and to Samten Gyatso's future tulku. 

My aunt somehow sensed that I had no desire to take responsibility for the 
monastery-and, to be honest, in my heart I had already given up any concern 
for it. Lachab was situated in a large valley, with many fields, and I had no desire 
to take care of them even though a normal person would have been more than 
happy to own them. Taking care of a monastery in Kham was a heavy burden: 
Frankly, it's a big headache. You are constantly dependent upon others and have 
many obligations. 

•What is the use of going through all that?• I thought. It was better to give up 
running a monastery altogether. . 

To tell the truth, I never had the wish to live in Kham and longed to journey 
through Central Tibet from one new place to another, with no fixed schedule or 
direction, but it would only be after Samten Gyatso's passing that I could do so. 

The temple at Fortress Peak wouldn't qualify as a monastery but fits what we 
call a gonchung-a small gompa. Actually, many, many centuries ago, FortreSs 
Peak was the residence of Bonpo meditators and many of them attained accom-
plishment there; I've heard amazing stories about them. Later this sacred place 
came into Buddhists' hands. Padmasambhava went there while he was in Tibet 
and, after he blessed it, many VAJRA GURU mantras naturally appeared on the · 
face of the cliffs. 

Several centuries later (in the early twelfth century), it was the practice place of 
Ga Lotsawa, or Galo for short, one of the first Karmapa's gurus and a translator of 
the Dharma who had been to India. Galo was a great master, comparable to the 



My Monastery and Enthronement 177 

deity Chakrasamvara in human form. In his writings we find an eloquent tribute 

describing the qualities of Fortress Peak. 
The story goes that in the early morning, Galo and one of his chief disciples flew 

across the valley to fetch water, then flew back. There are numerous footprints in 
the solid rock where they landed. Both the guru and his disciple were siddhas; you 
can still see the stupa built at Fortress Peak to hold his remains. 

Later on, an accomplished master from near the Chinese border took up resi-
dence at Fortress Peak. Later still, in the sixteenth century, the ninth Karmapa, 
Wangchuk Dorje, sent a message that the king of Nangchen's longevity would be 

assured if long-life practices were performed for him on the summit of Fortress 
Peak. Throughout the following centuries, masters would come once a· month to 

practice there at the request of the current king. In more recent times, Samten 
Gyatso and Chowang Tulku took turns.• so 

On the day I was enthroned, an extremely vicious gale blew up-call that an 
auspicious sign! It was so strong that some people couldn't stand up and it al-
most carried off the canopy. It seemed to be relentless, and the wind kept swirling 
around the gompa. I asked Samten Gyatso what it might mean. 

"I wonder,· he replied. "Maybe it's bad, maybe it's good. Maybe it's the guard-
ians, the protectors of the Dharma, showing off their powers~

I asked him again and he said, ·Who 

knows, perhaps this gompa will stay, per· 
h:1ps it will perish. For the remaining years 
of my life, it will stay, but during your time 
it will disappear. Who knows, during your 

lifetime perhaps Lachab will crumble and 
be destroyed by war." 

It seems he saw something, because he 
continued, "But it will be restored again 
sometime after that.•s• There is a link be· 
tween your health and this gompa. As long 
as it stands, you will be free of sickness, but 

when it crumbles, you too will fall ill. Some 
of the vital energy for your present life is 
anchored in Lachab. But then again, who 

knows? As long as the two of us are together, the gompa will be fine. I, of course, 
will stay here for the rest of my life, but I wonder if you will ever live here after 1 

pass away. 
"After I am gone," he continued, "I am not sure what will happen. I have the 

feeling that bad times are coming, severely bad times-the evil influence will come 

from the east." At the time, I wondered what he meant. He looked at me with clear, 

wide eyes. 
"If it happens that you are forced to leave, you must go to Nubri," Sam ten Gyatso 

added. 
"Where is Nubri?" I asked. 

"Right now it belongs to the Gorkha king in Nepal and so is no longer un· 

der the Tibetan government. A descendant of King Trisong Deutsen still lives 
there, as well as a couple of my disciples with deep faith in the Dharma. When 
you leave here, you will first go to Central Tibet, but after a while there you will 

be unable to remain. At that time, go to Nubri. The Nubri people are humble 

and simple. They are not rich, but they have deep appreciation for the Buddhist 

teachings. The one you must contact is the descendant of the Dharma king 
Trisong Deutsen."•u 

Around that time, the rulers of Ziling province, who were Muslims, did not 
favor us. Quite the contrary, the governor of Ziling beyond the northern border 

of Nangchen had already begun imposing increasingly heavy taxes on everyone in 
our region, including the monasteries. For example, a huge number of yak hides 
had to be handed over once a year. •n 



My Monastery and Enthronement 179 

Earlier, we had learned that Japan and China were at war, and Japan was in-
fticting heavy casualties and oppression in parts of China. Since we were under 
Chinese rule, upon hearing such rumors we anxiously wondered what would hap-
pen to China.'54 

This conversation took place long before the communist invasion-in fact, we 
hadn't eyen heard the word communist-and I wondered why he was telling me 
this-it seemed so out of context. But, in the end, it wasn't the governor of Ziling 
v;ho destroyed us, but the communists. 

This is one of the few times Samten Gyatso revealed any of his clairvoyant pow-
ers; otherwise he was a hidden yogi. He wouldn't even mention any special dreams. 

People may or may not believe in the power of the Dharma protectors, but let 
me tell this story anyway. 

Four monks from Lachab had gone on a pilgrimage to Mount Kailash. On the 
way back, they had to cross a great river that, because it was summer, had swollen 
~beyond normal. They walked along the bank trying to find a crossing, which in 
those days was not easy in Tibet. 

They had run out of food and were starving. For a while they sustained them-
Selves on a rotting sheep carcass they had found. With the help of a fire, they were 
~le to salvage enough cooked meat to carry on for another four or five days. As 
one monk later said, "We survived thanks to that sheep:' 

Finally, they sat down on the bank, and one of them said, "This is it! We're going 
to die anyway, so what's the use of walking further?" 

"If one of us were to die first, the others could eat his flesh. If it turns out to be 
me, don't hesitate; said another. They carried on like this for a while. 

Finally, the youngest one lamented tearfully, "I'm not sure I can eat meat from 
your body. Oh, what to do!" 

Their only hope, they all agreed, was to do the petition to Dusolma and Four-
.Armed Mahakala, both guardian protectors of Lachab. They must have put all 
their heart into it, supplicating from the depths of their being. 

"Look there!" one of them shouted. 
The others turned around and saw that the river had parted! 
;Later one of them told me, "It was wide enough to walk through; I figure it was 

about two arm spans. We have no idea why, but two walls of water were somehow 
held apart. This was no narrow river, I tell you! None of us could believe it, though, 
. and we discussed among ourselves whether this could really be happening-hav-
ingsuchdoubt was almost harder than starving:' 



180 EARLY YEARS 

Finally, one of them said, •Let's run for it!• and they dropped everything and 
ran across. 

•The walls were quivering as we made a dash for it: the monk continued, •and 
the moment we reached the other side, there was a loud SWOOSH! We turned 
around and saw that the gap had closed. This is no lie. I'm telling you, I've nothing 
to gain from making up such a story~ 

This monk was quite old when he told me the story. Independently, I went to 
the three others, who gave the exact same account. I made all of them swear on the 
name of their guru that they weren't lying. They were not great masters but mere~ 
ordinary monks. Their only asset was pure faith in their Dharma protectors. 

Hard to believe, isn't it? 

When I was around twenty, Samten Gyatso told me, •you appear to be someone 
who can give mind teachings. You are the kind of person who finds it all quite easy, 
not seeing how anyone could have problems understanding the nature of mind. 
You could end up too blase; then again, maybe you simply will be very confident. 

•sometimes I think you assume too much. I must caution you that there is one 
thing you should watch out for: on the one hand, you could assume it is all so 
simple that everyone would understand. But then, on the other hand, that's not 
the way things are. People will often comprehend something totally different from 
what you mean, concluding that there is nothing to gain, so that they become 
careless and give up. 

•you feel that realizing the nature of mind is simply a matter of course;' he 
continued, ·but I want you to understand: some people do not know the nature of 
mind, and there definitely is a reason for that. There are many people whose prac-
tice of'mind essence' is nothing more than remaining absentminded and unaware 
in the state of the all-ground.ass 

•Nevertheless, for the time being, you should go ahead and test your confidence 
on a few old men and women. You might be able to benefit one or two, so it's fine 
for you to teach them~ 

In this way, he gave me the go-ahead to begin teaching. 
I started giving people advice on understanding the nature of mind because I 

was very talkative. I couldn't help it; it would just slip oul! When I spent time with 
Samten Gyatso,IIistened in on whatever instructions he gave. Often it would be the 
pointing-out instruction and advice on how to truly meditate in the simplest way. 

Afterward, there might be some people outside his room who couldn't quite 
understand what he had said. They would ask me, •How can it be that easyr 



My Monastery and Enthronement 181 

And I would say, •Why do you think it has to be difficult? It really is so easy~ 
Then they would reply, ·But I don't get it~ 
And I'd tell them, •What do you mean, you don't get it? Just let be!• I had that 

attitude because I'd heard what my uncle had said and I'd just parrot it. 
My uncle would then call me in and repeat, •It seems you are the talkative type, 

as well as someone who thinks that recognizing mind nature is totally easy. I think 
that in the future you will be like this as well-you will be both talkative and some-
body who acts like it is really simple!• And he was right. 

On one hand, maybe with my teaching style I'm just fooling everybody, making 
it too simple. But on the other hand, this is really how it is! It is the truth. What is 
the use of trying to sit and push and struggle, when we can allow the three kayas 
ofbuddhahood to be naturally present? Why do we have to strain and contort our-
selves into an uncomfortable posture and an uptight meditative state with some 
00pe that in the future, after lots of effort, we may get there? We don't need to go 
through all that trouble and tension. All we need to do is totally let be and recog-
nize our nature right now. 

However, my style was mainly to just spin the heads of uneducated people, 
something for which I seem to have a knack. 

As I said, I started to talk about mind nature after having heard Sam ten Gyatso 
give instructions on it many times and understanding somewhat. So I would 
PJmetimes repeat what he had said to others, like ·a parrot giving a Dharma talk; 
tihich means trying to teach others a truth about which one has no personal ex-
perience or an instruction one has not personally practiced. 

So in those days I guess I acted the charlatan once more . 

. The Buddha realized that different beings have various capacities. So out of 
great compassion and skillful means, he gave an assortment of teachings, each 

·right for different individuals. Although the essence of all teachings of all enlight-
enedones is to simply let be in recognition of one's own nature, the Buddha taught 
11\idevariety of complex instructions in order to satisfy people at their own level. 
Another reason the Buddha and the great masters taught the nine vehicles is not 
;& that they couldn't leave well enough alone, but to make everybody happy. It 
seems to be human nature to love complication, to want to build up a lot of con-
crpts. Later on, of course, we must allow them to fall to pieces again. 

The great variety of teachings that exist doesn't change the fact that the very 
essence of the Dharma, the nature of mind, is extremely simple and easy. In fact, 
its so simple and easy that sometimes it's hard to believe! 



182 EARLY YEARS 

The general tradition for giving the pointing-out instruction to the nature of 
mind holds that we need to go step by step. First, we complete the reflections of 
the four mind-changings. Next, we go through the preliminary practices, and after 
that the yidam practice of deity, mantra and samadhi. And indeed, these are all still 
necessary, even if we have already received teachings on mind essence. Don't get 
the idea that suddenly all the practices taught by the enlightened ones are unirn· 
portant. On the contrary, they are incredibly important. 

Since it's not so easy nor very common for someone to ever have the oppor-
tunity to receive mind teachings, I felt that I should speak up and give it. Please 
remember that we can easily receive the other important teachings from various 
masters, so don't ignore them. Please be diligent in practice. In truth, perseverance 
makes the difference between buddhas and ordinary beings. 

There is a story from Kham in which an old guy says to a lama, ·When you 
talk about the benefits of recognizing mind essence, it's certain that you have no 
problem; in fact, even this old sinner will probably be safe from rebirth in hell. But 
when you talk about the consequences of our actions, there's no doubt I will end 
up in hell. In fact, I wonder if even you might not be in trouble, my lama!• 

A phony meditator might be able to fool others while alive, but there's no doubt 
he'll be caught unprepared when facing the bardo. I am quite certain that, in the 
long run, the greatest benefit comes from simply trusting in the Three Jewels. Of 
course, if one also has authentic experience of mind essence, then, as the Kagyu 
saying tells us, •Though death is regarded with so much dread, a yogi's death is a 
small awakening~ 

I also feel that even if one still hasn't reached the splendid heights of experience and 
realization, some simple, sound comprehension is extremely beneficial. An under-
standing, even intellectually, of emptiness-the empty and awake quality of mind-
will surely help you cross over to the other side in the bardo. When sentient beings 
pass on, it is their own mind that becomes bewildered-and it is their own mind that 
needs to come to their rescue, since no one else is going to do it at that time.'s6 

Therefore, a sound understanding of mind essence could become the reminder 
that liberates in the bardo. The most essential benefit, however, comes from adu· 
ally training in mind essence while you are alive; this is the only thing that will 
ensure true success. First, liberate your own stream of being through realization, 
then liberate others through your compassionate activity. Proceeding in this way 
makes a human life meaningful. 

When I taught, some understood and others didn't, but I kept at it just the 
same. This bold attitude has stuck with me and is now my style. I don't know if it 
helps others much. The teachings on mind essence may be the most precious and 



My Monastery and Enthronement 183 

secret They may also be •liberation through hearing~ so that whoever hears them 
will be benefited. So I feel it's acceptable to give them from time to time. 
1 don't claim that everyone to whom I explain the essence of mind recognizes 

and trains in the genuine experience. There are many different types of students. 
Those who don't recognize are inevitably preoccupied by fleeting phenomena and 
,;n get distracted. But even if they have not recognized the natural state of mind, 
anyone who has heard the essential teaching, even once, will slowly grow closer 
Ill realization-so long as they don't abandon the attempt entirely but continue 
to practice. Those who have recognized, and so have some trust in mind essence, 
cannot give up the Dharma, even if someone tells them to. This springs from con-
fidence in their personal experience. 

At one point, Samten Gyatso went on a pilgrimage around the mountain above 
Palpung monastery in Derge, walking all the way accompanied by Dudul, his at-
tendant and my close friend. An old lama who Dudul ran into turned out to have 
been a personal disciple of the first Kongtrul. 

"Where are you from?• he asked Dudul. 
"I'm from Nangchen~ Dudul replied. 
"Ah, then maybe you know this Nangchen lama who I hear is visiting some-

llilere around here,• inquired the old lama. •His name is Samten Gyatso, and he 
bas been both the teacher and disciple of the great Karmapa. I know of him since 
he is often mentioned in his collected writings. Do you happen to know where he 
is staying! 

"Yeah, I do know~ Dudul replied, ·since I'm his attendant!" 
"111 be damned! Please tell me~ begged the old lama. After getting directions, he 

then declared, •Thank you so much. Early tomorrow I will surely pay him a visit!" 
The next morning, the old lama came to visit Samten Gyatso, and they had a 

long. profound exchange. When the old lama came outside, he sat down with a 
cup oftea and asked my friend, ·so tell me, how many disciples has this lama?• 

"Not that many close disciples~ said Dudul. ·He gives a lot of empowerments, 
but not that many meditating hermits call themselves his personal disciples!" 

"Alas! What a shame,• exclaimed the old lama. •It's obviously true what they say 
about those spineless folk from Nangchen. Why are they so damn ignorant? Here 
they have a fine meditation master with such a high view-he totally amazed me 
11ith his answers to my questions-and you say he doesn't have many disciples?! 
Are the people of Nangchen no better than cattle? I really pity you guys!" 

That old lama was speaking the truth: not that many people gave up everything 
ID foUow Samten Gyatso, certainly not compared to the vast numbers who be-
came disciples of the first Khyentse and Kongtrul. In fact, only four or five come to 



184 EARLY YEARS 

mind-but they were some very fine meditators indeed. If a lama was to be judged 
by the number of his followers, then Sam ten Gyatso was nothing special at all 

Yet he was regarded as a lineage guru by the fifteenth Karmapa. Drukchen 
Jamgon and Taklung Tsetrul, who were some of the most prominent lamas in 
Central Tibet. In Nangchen, he also transmitted teachings to the masters Adeu 
and the second Tsoknyi and became one of their root gurus. As for lamas in 
Derge, you can include Dzongsar Khyentse, who received the restricted section 
of the New Treasures at Fortress Peak. And Karsey Kongtrul came to Tsikey to 
receive the New Treasures from Sam ten Gyatso. 

The old lama did touch upon a vital characteristic of my country: scholastic edu· 
cation was not the main emphasis. Not that I'm proud of that. On the other hand. in 
such an environment, only realization would qualify someone to be a lama-not just 
talk. Impostors had a hard time gaining a foothold where I came from. 

Samten Gyatso occupied a very prominent position in Nangchen and was busy 
with his many responsibilities. But since we shared the same monastery, I had no 
problem spending time with him. Sharing a monastic household is much like Jiv. 
ing as a family under the same roof. So I had plenty of opportunity to ask questions 
and receive guidance. 

I remember well one particular instruction that Samten Gyatso gave me at an 
early age. It had to do with a teaching on the profound topic of essence, nature and 
capacity. He said, ·The word capacity refers to the unconfined basis for experi· 
ence, as in the moment just before something takes place. Once the arising has 
occurred, it usually has already turned into a thought. Capacity means the basis 
for that to happen, an unimpeded quality of awareness. 

•This unimpeded quality is extremely subtle and significant. Once you ac· 
knowledge this unimpededness, nothing more needs to be done. In this unim· 
pededness, it is impossible to find any subject or object. The analogy for this is 
a bright mirror, a readiness for experience to unfold without any preconception 
whatsoever. So please understand very well the third of these three: essence, 
nature and capacity.• 

This is an example of how Sam ten Gyatso would teach. I feel very fortunate to 
have been instructed by such a master when I was young, because there are many 
people who misidentify capacity as being not the basis-like the mirror-but the 
manifestation, like the reflection in the mirror. But the reflection means that the 
mind and sense object have already linked up, and the attention has already been 
caught up in distraction. 



My Monastery and Enthronement 185 

"One should not identify the capacity with being caught up in subject, object 
and the act of perceiving: he said. •An unconfined basis for experience means 
the readiness, being able to experience-just ready to be, but not yet involved in 
dualistic experience. If your training is in this readiness, rather than in conceptual 
thinking, you won't be caught up in duality during daily activities. This capacity, in 
essence, is the unimpeded omniscience of all buddhas, which is totally unlike the 
attention that focuses on one thing while eliminating everything else:' 57 

Like others, tulku's obviously have emotions too. Just look at Marpa, the trans· 
lator, with his incredibly strong emotions, blazing like flames. But the moment an 
experienced meditator looks into the nature of mind every thought and emotion 
vanishes like snow flakes falling on a hot plate. At that moment a meditator is 
truly free of any attachment. Marpa may have treated Milarepa with a lot of abuse, 
harsh words and beatings-but that was totally unlike the anger of an ordinary 
person in that there wasn't even a shred of selfishness involved. You can't only 
~dge people by their behavior. 

Even though his kindness was boundless, Sam ten Gyatso could be quite wrath· 
ful at times. Once in a while, I saw him slap one of his attendants. Sometimes I 
even had to bring him the cane and that scared me too, because even one whack 
would hurt-it was big! Occasionally, he gave more than a little tap. He could give 
areal thrashing, especially to Dudul, who often had it coming. 

"With this guy, there is no other way: Sam ten Gyatso once said. •He's too dense, 
and a slap of the stick gets through to him; it's effective for at least five or six days: 
Afterward, Dudul would act like a real human being. bright and gentle-at least 
at first Then he would start to be argumentative again, finding fault and loudly 
oomplaining about every little thing. 

"Why don't you just let it drop?" I often told him, •Nothing is that bad. Don't 
)'DU remember what happened to you last time?" 
. But the story would always end with Sam ten Gyatso sending me to fetch the 

cane one more time. Oh my! Once, Sam ten Gyatso smacked him so many times 
lihought he wouldn't be able to walk the next morning, but when I met Dudul 
afterward, he was carrying on with his duties as if nothing had happened. 

The story often repeated itself, but he just wouldn't listen. Once, I asked him 
about it and he said, •That was nothing. I don't care that much. It hurts for a mo· 
ment and then passes: 

He too had a lot of devotion for Sam ten Gyatso. 



21 

The Young J(armapa 

Another major influence early in my life was the sixteenth Karmapa, Rigpey 
Dorje. I first met him in east Tibet at Tana Gompa.'" I was young at the time, and 
Samten Gyatso brought me along as his attendant. I didn't become that close to 
the Karmapa then-he just knew me as ·the tulku who was with Samten Gyatso~ 

When the Karmapa was young, he was pretty strong-headed; you couldn't force 
him to study, and he was very playful. Only Samten Gyatso could intimidate him 
enough to get him to pursue his studies. For that reason, the Karmapa received 
quite a few teachings from Samten Gyatso. They later became very close. 

Thanks to the communist forces, the Karmapa later came to Nangchen.'1' He 
was supposed to travel directly to Derge, his intended destination, but was unable 
to do so because of a border upheaval between Kham and China. 

This is when we first heard about •the communists:" We knew them by their 
Chinese name, gungtreng, which soon took on an ominous connotation. We also 
heard of someone called Mao Tse-tung, and that the gungtreng had arrived at the 
old border town, Dartsedo and begun a march on Derge. 

This was around the time when the Chinese forces were at war with the Japanese. 
Those in power in China were coming under increased pressure from two sides, 
since the communists were becoming ever more powerful and raising an army of 
their own. If the Chinese forces had been able to overpower the Japanese army, 
they would have been able to suppress the communists, but they were stretched 
too thin. 

It seems to be an old story, often repeated: the powers that be in the capital 
are distracted by good times and enjoying the status quo, while their opponents 
and neighboring countries begin to eat away at their power base. While China's 
upper class was indolent and careless, the communists were busy day and night 
preparing to take over the country. 

The next thing we heard was that one of the governors of Derge had been 



1Tte Young Karmapa 187 

captured. But then the communists were defeated and disappeared for a while. I 

was around sixteen at the time. 
After the governor of Derge was released by the communists and returned to 

power, the feeling was that it was now safe for the Karmapa to visit there. He 
\isited many places along the way, including various monasteries in Nangchen 
that were under royal patronage. He was invited to Lachab as well. And before he 
proceeded to the famous Dilyak Gompa, my Tsangsar relatives also hosted him 
and his party. 

On this trip, the Karmapa had been given some small white abras, a local type 
of mouse-hare. Sometimes people would keep an abra as a pet, but only in a box, 
otherwise they would run off. When I was young, I had two or three of them, but 
they all ran away. They are not easy to hold on to either, and it was almost certain 

that if you took them out of the box you would lose them. But our Wish-Fulfilling 
jewel, the Karmapa, refused to imprison his pets in a box, so he had five or six 

.abras running free in his tent. 
I tried to warn him. ·Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, you have to keep them caged. Mine 

took off as fast as they could: 

37. 
The Sixteenth 
Karmapa-
a willful 
incarnation 



188 EARLY YEARS 

·ooesn't matter, doesn't matter: he said. •Let them all out:" 
The abras darted around the tent. It looked to me as though they were circum-

ambulating him, and they didn't even seem to mind when he picked them up. 
Though the tent was open, they would stay near him; not a single one ever seemed 
to want to escape. 

One day, the Karmapa decided to dye his abras yello~ and red. They seemed 
entranced by him, and so when he decided to change their coat to a different color. 
they just sat still and let him do it. Abras usually have light colored fur, and I was 
worried that if the ones the Karmapa had dyed were set free again, the other abras 
might attack them. But that never happened. Not one of them minded when he 
dipped them in water to wash the dye off. 

I must say, the way the young Karmapa handled the abras impressed me deeply. 

It was during this journey that Samten Gyatso became the Karmapa's tu-
tor. Back at Tsurphu, the Karmapa was taught by a very level-headed but strict 
lama. I heard that he would sometimes bolt the door from inside, prostrate to 
the young Karmapa three times-and that was often enough of a warning for 
our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel to snap back into line and concentrate on his studies. 
A certain mixture of fear and respect ensured that he made good progress in his 
education. 

However, there was a relative of the Karmapa who was a bit fainthearted and 
couldn't bear the thought of the precious incarnation being physically disciplined 
on occasion. So he scolded the tutor, ·You treat the Karmapa, a buddha incarnate, 
like an ordinary person. Your behavior is criminal!• 

At that time, the young Karmapa had many visions and prophecies, and he 
would share these revelations-including which buddha he had just seen and what 
they told him about the future-with this tutor, who would write them down. 
Some of these predictions were mixed up with the Karmapa's remarks about such-
and-such relative being a ·demon: and eventually the fellow who had complained 
found out that this had been written about him. 

He took this personally and decided that although the tutor had good inten-
tions, he obviously wasn't up to the task of educating such an eminent incarnation. 
So the relatives took the opportunity to relieve the tutor of his duties. This was a 
shame in a way, as the Karmapa had learned to read very well under this tutor. 

The official statement was, ·our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel has no need for a tu-
tor. The Karmapa is a buddha whose qualities spontaneously manifest. He is not 
someone who should be treated as an ordinary person, beaten and pinched. So 



The Young Karmnpa 189 

during a meeting it was decided to tell the tutor that his services are no longer 
required:" 

The young Karmapa was sad and defended his tutor, saying, •yes, he does oc-
casionally pinch and strike me, but he does so out of a good heart. He only wants 
me to advan_ce in my studies:" 

The Karmapa insisted that the tutor be given nice presents, including a fine set 
of monk's robes. Then for a while the Karmapa went without a teacher. 

But when the Karmapa arrived at Dilyak, the lamas of Nangchen insisted that 
another tutor be appointed. This is when Samten Gyatso's name came up. Since 
he already had been one of the gurus of the Karmapa's previous incarnation, he 
seemed the obvious choice. And so Samten Gyatso was asked to assume the role 
of tutor. He replied, ·rm getting old, but I will serve at Palpung. It is a great mon-
mery;" So Samten Gyatso became the Karmapa's tutor during the journey from 
Dilyak. 

Samten Gyatso's teaching style was never to beat the teenage Karmapa but 
instead to punish his own attendant Dudul right before the Karmapa's eyes, 
which had the desired effect. •1 never had to hit him," Samten Gyatso told me. 
'Striking Dudul was enough to get the Karmapa to stay in his seat and continue 
his studies:" 

But upon their arrival at Palpung, Samten Gyatso asked the great Situ if he 
could be excused from his teaching duties. Situ replied, •1 realize that you are old 
and have gone to a lot of trouble. You were one of the teachers of the previous 
Karmapa, so I can't force you to be a tutor now. So I'll ask the Khyentse of Palpung 
to take over:" 

Palpung Khyentse was a disciple of the fifteenth Karmapa and had wonderful 
qualities, but he was such a stern presence that the Karmapa almost didn't dare 
move when he was around. Even though Palpung Khyentse was a perfect candi-
date, after he slapped the Karmapa a couple of times, influential members of the 
Karmapa's family again found reason to object and wanted him dismissed. 

'Even a lama is human; even the illusory body is flesh and blood, so unless it 
gets hurt a bit, the Karmapa won't study; Palpung Khyentse said in his defense. •A 
Karmapa is supposed to be a teacher for the world as a whole, so the more edu-
cated he is, the better:" 

·He must have struck the Karmapa a few more times, because finally the 
Karmapa's father went before the great Situ and said, ·Even though he is the 
Karmapa, he is also my child; being my son, he belongs to me. My wife and I can-



190 EARLY YEARS 

not bear to witness him being physically punished. You decide how to implement 
it, but we want Khyentse of Palpung dismissed.• 

Personally, 1 think this was a mistake. The Karmapa was moving in a very good 
direction in his education. But his father, an important and influential official, was 
unyielding and difficult. He had the haughty attitude of a Khampa aristocrat and 
had no qualms about placing his opinion above that of most lamas. 

The great Situ replied, •Khyentse of Palpung is no ordinary man. Not only is he 
the reincarnation of the great Khyentse, he is also one of the four main lamas of 
Palpung.aeo How can 1 tell one of the great lamas of Palpung to resign?• 

·But you must!• the Karmapa's father insisted. ·otherwise we will take care of 
our little tulku ourselves:' 

·You don't know how to take care of a Karmapa: Situ replied. ·He is being edu· 
cated, and he will turn out well:' 

Yet no matter what Situ said, the father wouldn't listen. And in the end, Palpung 
Khyentse was relieved of his duties. After that it was impossible to find anyone of 
the same caliber in terms of wisdom and erudition to be his teacher. 

After one khenpo was let go, the Tentrul of Surmang was appointed; he proved 
to be a boon, transmitting the Treasury of Knowledgt>., the famous work by the 
great Kongtrul, from cover to cover over the course of three years. But he fell ill 
and passed away soon after. 

By then, the Karmapa had grown into a man who made his own decisions and 
was receiving transmissions from Situ and Karsey Kongtrul. 

During the Karmapa's journey through Nangchen, his mother fell ill. Since my 
father was renowned for successful healing rituals, he was called upon to travel 
with our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, and 1 got to go along. But at Dilyak my father asked 
to be excused from traveling any farther. 

·ooes this mean that my mother is going to be okay nowr the Karmapa 
asked. 

My father said, ·rve done what 1 could do: implying that she would die soon. 
•1 have done the Cho ritual every evening, and it appears there is nothing further 
to be done:' 

•Tell me my mother is not dying: the Karmapa repeated 
·sorry, 1 can't tell you that,• my father replied. 
The next morning, Chimey Dorje and I left. We later heard that the Karmapa's 

mother died a week later. The Karmapa had her remains cremated on the vast 
plain north of Dilyak. 



Tlze Young Karmapa 191 

Chimey Dorje insisted on leaving before she died, although he had been asked 
to stay longer. 

'There always comes a point when supportive rituals are no longer of any ben-
efit: Chimey Dorje told me. 

'What do you mean?" I inquired. 
'Near the. end, whenever I looked at her with a Cho eye, she had no head; he 

explained. "To me that means death is inevitable. That is why I asked to be ex-
cused." 

The next time I met the Karmapa was at Surmang monastery, where I had gone 
~greet my father on his return from Ziling after a long journey. Fortunately, this 
coincided with the Karmapa's visit to that monastery. In those days, I alternated 
J>etween being my father's and Sam ten Gyatso's attendant, depending on which of 
them was in the Karmapa's entourage. 

At Surmang 1 had a chance to see the Karmapa's horse. This horse was quite 
unusual, known to give blessings by placing one of its hooves on people's heads. 
People would stand in line and as the horse touched their head it made a sound 
that-with a bit of imagination-sounded like HUNG HUNG HUNG. Most people 
got touched very lightly, but once in a while someone got whacked. 

l thought to myself, "Who knows what that horse will do to me? Maybe it will 
split my skull open!" So no one was going to make me get a "blessing~ I preferred 
to stand and watch the others. 

Word went around that the Karmapa's horse was giving blessings. There was a 
long line of people who, each in turn, gave white scarves and offerings of money to 
the horse. In Khampa style, they would not make such a request empty-handed. 

Of course, the horse didn't speak. But it did make a sound each time it touched 
a person's head and many people heard the sound as OM MANI PADME HUNG. I 
was waiting for someone to receive one of its "dynamic" blessings, but it didn't 
happen that day; the horse was quite gentle with everyone. 

Many years later, I heard that one day the horse just sat down on its hindquarters 
and passed away, then continued sitting there. Pretty amazing, wouldn't you agree? 

Once in a while, the Karmapa would reveal his clear perception of the death 
and rebirth of beings. One time, on a journey north, some villagers offered the 
Karmapa a horse. After receiving the horse, the Karmapa turned to his general 
secretary and said, "This horse is the rebirth of your father~ 



192 EARLY YEARS 

The secretary was very upset and asked the Karmapa if he could do something. 
The Karmapa replied, ·what do you want me to do? He's a horse! He's already 
taken rebirth and there he is~ 

·Then, please, give the horse to me and I will take care of it myself,' the secre-
tary pleaded. •No one will ride it:' 

For two years the secretary kept the horse, fed and groomed it, and took the 
very best care of it, until the horse passed away. 

On another journey, the Karmapa was passing through a valley with a follow· 
ing of about ninety horsemen, when all of a sudden a kid goat broke away from 
its flock. It ran after the Karmapa as best it could, bleating and trying to keep up. 
Our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel turned to look and then said to his servant, ·rake the 
kid back to the village we just came through, find its owner and ask him to give it 
tome~ 

The servant took the kid, which had a colored string around its neck, under his 
arm and rode back to the village. The colored string made it easy to identify the 
goat and the servant was quickly able to find its owner, who readily agreed to offer 
it to the Karmapa. 

The goat in tow, he caught up with the Karmapa's traveling party by nightfall 
He brought the kid to the Karmapa and asked, ·Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, why are you 
so interested in this goat?• 

·oo you remember that orphan who was given to me some years ago and re-
cently diedr the Karmapa replied. •That's him, poor guy! Somehow he must have 
recognized me and, unable to bear to be separated again, he ran after me bleating 
at the top of his voice. I'll keep him for a while~ 

For the rest of the journey back to Tsurphu, the Karmapa kept the small goat 
as a pet.

Grandmother's Death 

Spontaneous devotion is often due to aspirations and karmic links created in for-
mer lifetimes, and my grandmother felt such devotion for Old Kongtrul. When 
she fell seriously ill, she heard that his reincarnation, Karsey Kongtrul, was cur-
rently residing at Karma Gon south of Nangchen. She sent a messenger to invite 
~As this happened to coincide with the annual drubchen of Tukdrub Barchey 
Kunsel- the most famous of the great terton's treasures- performed at Tsikey, 
Karsey Kongtrul was asked to preside over the ceremonies.'6' 

While at Tsikey, Karsey Kongtrul stayed in a very special chapel. This little tem-
ple, adjacent to the assembly hall, was called Kutsab Lhakhang because it contained 
the statue regarded as the representative (kutsab) of the Lotus-Born master in the 
form of Guru Mahasukha. Even though it is quite small, it is a rather famous statue 
connected with a cycle of terma teachings known as the Spontaneous Fulfillment 
of\VIShes, which had been revealed nearby. 
After its revelation, the great Khyentse saw 
a vision in which this statue grew to the size 
of a mountain. 

Let me tell you a little bit about Karsey 
Kongtrul. He mostly resided at Palpung. 
Later, at Tsurphu, I received the Treasury of 
Precious Termas from him. You may remem-
ber I mentioned the great scholar Tashi Ozer, 
a learned and accomplished master and a 
disciple of both Khyentse and Old Kongtrul. 
Years before, Tashi Ozer had been invited to 
Tsurphu to give the fifteenth Karmapa the 
reading transmission for the Kangyur, the 
translated words of the Buddha.

When Tashi Ozer had finished reading this voluminous collection of the 
Buddha's words, the Karmapa said with gratitude, "Whatever wish you have, I will 
fulfill~ 

Tashi Ozer replied, "I have only one request: as you know, we both have the 
same root guru, and as he has been born as your son, please let me take him back 
to Palpung monastery~ 

"Very well. I will not break my word," the Karmapa said. But since the tuJku 
was only three years old, Tashi Ozer knew that he couldn't have the child right 
away. Still, he is credited with eventually returning the Kongtrul incarnation to 
Palpung.

Karsey Kongtrul-

the son of 
the fifteenth 

Karmapa 



Grandmother's Death 195 

Much later, Karsey Kongtrul requested Samten Gyatso to confer the complete 
empowerments of Tukdrub Barchey Kunsel and so had come to Tsikey to receive 
them. The empowerments were given in Konchok Paldron's private room; I was 
one of the assistants for the empowerments, alternating with Dudul every other 
day. 

Karsey Kongtrul was the son of the fifteenth Karmapa and also a reincarnation 
of the great Kongtrul. When Sam ten Gyatso was ready to give the empowerments, 
often Karsey Kongtrul didn't seem to be in any rush to come in. Sometimes he 
would be out strolling, relaxing or discussing various topics. 

One day, Samten Gyatso had finished the preparation for the next empower-
ment and said to me, "Well, now! Isn't Rinpoche coming? Go look for him.· 

1 went to Karsey Kongtrul's quarters and said, •The empowerment is ready to 
be given: 

He replied, ·very well~ But being a person of high social status, he felt no pres-
sure to hurry; he took his own sweet time, slowly ambling toward the empower-
ment room. When he finally arrived, Samten Gyatso, as usual, came out of the 
.inner chamber to welcome him as a sign of respect. 

fve mentioned that Sam ten Gyatso could sometimes be a bit stern. As he stood 
waiting there, we could see he had a pretty wrathful demeanor, and what he said 
next to Kongtrul scared even me. 

:"We all know you're the son of the Karmapa and the rebirth of the great 
Kongtrul. But it is you who have ordered me to give these empowerments and 
that is why I'm doing it. Isn't it true that I didn't insist on offering them to you? 
Therefore, if you want to receive the empowerments, come when they are ready to 
be given. If you don't want to come when they are ready, all you have to do is tell 
me. Then I won't go to all this trouble for nothing.• 
. Seeing Samten Gyatso's fierce expression put a scare into Karsey Kongtrul. 

liom then on, he was afraid to come late and his cook was always waiting next to 
me for the signal to go fetch his teacher, asking, "Is it time? Is it time?" 

Once, his cook leaned over and whispered to me, "1 shouldn't be saying this 
because he is also the guru of the Karmapa, but isn't Sam ten Gyatso pretty wrath-
ful?" ' 

Nevertheless, Samten Gyatso gave Karsey Kongtrul more than one hundred 
empowerments. 

During these empowerments, Karsey Kongtrul asked Uncle Tersey if he would 
be'So kind as to give him the reading transmission for the first volume of the 



EARLY YEARS 

New Treasures known as Essence Manual of Ora/Instruction. Of course Karsey 
Kongtrul wanted Uncle Tersey to sit on a throne-to which Uncle Tersey re-
sponded by immediately sitting down on the floor. 

·oon't force this heavy burden upon me: Uncle Tersey implored, •making me 
the teacher instead of the disciple! The only way I could give you this transmission 
is by presenting it in the form of a mandala offering:' 

Uncle Tersey was an extremely simple person that way and sincerely humble, 
so they argued back and forth. Karsey Kongtrul even sent for several cushions, but 
Uncle Tersey refused to sit on those as well. Finally, he agreed to sit just a bit high· 
er-one thin cushion more than normal-and gave the reading transmission. 

Uncle Tersey's utter humility was one of the reasons I never received more 
than a couple of empowerments from him. Instead I received most of the New 
Treasures from Sam ten Gyatso. As was his style-so meticulous and exacting-he 
would neither omit nor mispronounce even a single syllable. Although the £5sence 
Manual of Ora/Instruction is only a single volume in length, it still took him two 
days to read it aloud for Karsey Kongtrul. 

Karsey Kongtrul once told me that he had performed a drubchen three times 
using the treasure Tukdrub Barchey Kunse/, and each time, without fail, there were 
special signs. •please tell me what they were: I asked. 

·once a profuse amount of nectar poured forth, very sweet and slightly sour 
like excellent chang; it flowed from the torma on the shrine all the way to the en· 
trance of the temple. Another time, the liquid in the am rita and rakta vessels ori 
the shrine began to boil, sounding like roiling water, and rays of rainbow light sur~ 
rounded the shrine inside the assembly hall, extending to the farthest walls, for all 
two or three hundred participants to see. The third time we also prepared sacred 
medicine and its sweet fragrance could be smelled seven days' walk away. In my 
whole life I have never witnessed signs as amazing as during those three times. 

·u you want to ensure having extraordinary indications and signs, then the 
Tukdrub is outstanding; Karsey Kongtrul said. 

All this could also have been due to the combination of the profound terma 
teaching and such an extremely great master. ·w<?uldn't these signs also have 
something to do with you being present?• I asked. 

•How special am I compared to the Lotus-Born? Tukdrub is the method for real-
izing his mind. I am quite happy to have seen only a few tiny signs of his greatness~ 

Karsey Kongtrul was a fully ordained monk as well as a master who could or-
dain others. So, at the drubchen ceremony he presided over, many people took the 



Grandmother's Death 197 

opportunity to take monk's vows. As it happened, my uncle Sang-Ngak said to me, 
llSing the affectionate title for the master, "Why don't you ask our Noble Protector 
to become a monk too? It is much better to be fully ordained if you want to uphold 
the Buddha's teachings. Look at your father and all the hassle he has with his wives 
and children- it's so much trouble to be a householder. Then look at me and how 
easy it is living the life of a simple monk. 

'The only way to keep your freedom is to become a monk- if 1 want to stay or 
go, it's my decision and mine only. Once you hook up with a woman, I tell you, 
sooner or later you will be under her control. Once you have children you have 
~look after them as well as their mother- and sometimes her family too! Look 
around you: how many people are their own master? Compared to Sam ten Gyatso 
and me, don't you think it is much more difficult for your father and for Uncle 
Tersey, who is a ngakpa? Do yourself a favor and think this over really well. Why 
:don't you just go ahead and become a monk?" 

Samten Gyatso was also in the room, but he didn't say a word. 
I replied, ·1 can't make up my mind:' 
'What's so hard in deciding about this? Right now we are graced by the visit of 

the reincarnation of the great Kongtrul, who is truly Vairotsana returned in hu-
man form. You have a perfect opportunity. Don't think about it- just do it!" 

Again I answered, ''I'll have to think about it. Give me time." 
That afternoon, he brought it up again and yet again the next morning. Uncle 

'Sang·Ngak was not considered a penni-
less lama, since he had no monastery to 
look after and now he said, ''I'll give you 
~!own down to the smallest item, if you 
y,ilJ take the monk ordination." 
:Finally l broke the news to him, "l have 

honestly questioned myself about this but 
. have failed to . find any wish to become 
·a 'monk. Of course I want to realize the 
·Dharma- that goes without saying- but 
·!have no inclination to be fully ordained. 
· WJlat is the use of being a monk if one's 
heart isn't in it? Shouldn't it come from 
?neself? Honestly, Rinpoche, there is no 

· Use in being forced rather than being in-
. ~ired by true renunciation. Please don't 
push me so hard."

The tulku of 
Karsey Kongtrul 



198 EARLY YEARS 

Yet he didn't give up; he came back again and again to see if I had had a change 
of heart. On the other hand, though himself a monk of outstanding integrity, 
Samten Gyatso never said a thing to me about becoming a monk. 

In the end, I told Uncle Sang-Ngak, •It is very kind of you to entice me with aD 
your wealth as a present, but I have made up my mind. Even if someone were to 
offer me a yak-load of pure gold, I would not take ordination at this time~ 

·well, well: he responded. •I see you have indeed made up your mindt And 
that was the end of that. 

That is why I am still a layperson, a common householder. Out of fondness, I 
wear some of the Buddha's robes, like the shawl, but actually I am a worldly man. 

The reason I didn't take the ordination then or any time after was simply that 1 
didn't trust that I could keep the vows. Not only did Samten Gyatso never touch 
women, he never even touched meat or liquor. Uncle Sang-Ngak was no different 

If you take monk's vows, you should keep them pure, like my uncles or like 
Karmey Khenpo. I have great respect for anyone who does so, but not for the half. 
hearted renunciate so common nowadays. Maybe it was my lack of pure percep-
tion, but I didn't see that many pure monks even then. 

I had a strong feeling that it wouldn't do to merely put on robes and be a monk 
in name only. Instead, I decided to be honest about who I really was and to dress 
accordingly. I thought why should I hide my shortcomings? It's like the saying, 
•What's the use of wrapping shit in brocader 

I attended the drubchen at Tsikey, as did Samten Gyatso, Uncle Tersey and my 
father, who all sat up front near Karsey Kongtrul as he presided. During the tea 
breaks, they would all go up to their rooms for a bit, and one afternoon after a break 
none of them returned. I began to fear that my grandmother had left her body-
and sure enough, someone came to tell me that Konchok Paldron had passed on. 

Apparently, just before she died, she told Karsey Kongtrul, •I have now reached 
the final point between birth and death.• 

Karsey Kongtrul remained with her for a bit and gave the instruction called "the 
reminder for samadhi~ He then went down to his own quarters. I joined my father, 
my uncles and Penjik in the main room upstairs.'63 

Uncle Tersey was the first to say anything. He was in the habit of acting as if he 
had absolutely no self-confidence, and said, •Here we are, her four sons. Among 
us, I am the one who usually stayed with our mother; I am the one who was closest 
to her. You all would come and go, but I stayed by her side. Now she is gone-gone! 
And it feels as if my heart has been torn out:" . 



Grandmother's Death 199 

Tears were streaming down his checks as he continued, •I am deeply worried 
now when I think of the subtle workings of the law of karma. What will happen to 
our Precious Mother! 

The others sat there and said nothing as Uncle Tersey wept. Finally, Samten 
Gyatso said, •stop it now! What use are tears?· 

"Whether of use or not, when someone is deeply sad, tears come-I can't help 
it," Uncle Tersey explained. 

"You are not the only sad one-we all are. Aren't we all children of the same 
motherr asked Sam ten Gyatso. 

"But where is she going to go now?· Uncle Tersey lamented. ·oon't you remem-
ber the story about Smritijnana, who went all the way from India to eastern Tibet 
to rescue his own mother, who had taken rebirth inside a stone in the hearth of a 
house there! 

Uncle Tersey was referring to the story of the Indian pandita who came to Tibet 
but, not knowing the language, had to work as a shepherd for three years. In the 
end, he pretended he wanted to leave, and the landlord asked him what he wanted 
as a farewell present. The master pointed to a large stone in the fireplace. It was an 
unusual request, but he was given the stone. When he split it open, a large insect 
was found in a crevice, where it was being tortured each day by the heat. 

The master then entered samadhi and, in front of everyone's eyes, the insect 
was enveloped in rainbow light. The light rose into the sky. Then the master picked 
up the insect's carcass and tossed it into the fire. 

With tears still welling up, Uncle Tersey continued. ·Even though he was such a 
great master, his mother still didn't fare well. The law of karma is so subtle. Think 
about it! Our mother might be in trouble. Oh, where will she go now? 

"And don't you remember the story of Old Khyentse's mother, who was a mun-
dane type of dakini'? When she passed away, he had to practice intensively, direct-
inghis power of samadhi into purifying her obscurations. Isn't it true that it's hard 
to find a master greater than he, in this day and age? Even so, his mother was in 
trouble after she died. 

"Of course, our mother was Chokgyur Lingpa's daughter, but after he passed 
away, she had one child after another and lived as a daughter-in-law in someone 
else's home. She went through great suffering. Of course, she practiced more, later 
inher life, but I still worry about her. That's why I am so sad:' 
· · Since Uncle Tersey was known for making scenes like this, Sam ten Gyatso 
broke in: ·oon't talk like that! Pull yourself together and think! We are all close 
family here, so we can speak freely. Listen to me! First of all, Chokgyur Lingpa 
was no ordinary person, but rather the personal emissary of the Lotus-Born. As 



200 EARLY YEARS 

you well know, all of the great terton's main followers, headed by the ten primary 
Dharma holders, were predicted by Padmasambhava. 

"And you must be aware of this line of prophecy: 'Three sons will appear as em· 
anations of the three chief bodhisattvas.' One of these three, no doubt was Tsewang 
Norbu, another was Wangchok Dorje-and the third was our mother. This is not 
something you can say in public; in this day and age, people would get the wrong 
impression if they heard this. Nevertheless, mother is an emanation ofVajrapani, 
the Lord of Secrets. I don't have even a shred of doubt about this. You wouldn't 
call Chokgyur Lingpa a charlatan, would you? And would you call the Lotus-Born 

a liar? So pull yourself together! 
"Would Vajrapani be forced to take rebirth in hell? Think about it!" Samten 

Gyatso continued, "It's not possible; it goes against the very nature of things as well 
as against the Dharma. I'm not at all worried about our mother-I know she is far· 
ing better than well. I have a totally pure perception of her; not even for a moment 
do I entertain the thought that she could go to the lower realms. 

"I am only saying this in private to family, but she is one of the three emanations 
that were predicted. The causes and circumstances for her to be born as one of 
Chokgyur Lingpa's three sons were fully present, but people say that some pollu-
tion of samaya caused a change in gender. They claim that one moment of obstina· 
cy on the part of Chokgyur Lingpa's consort caused her son to be born a daughtet 
But, on the other hand, because she was born as a woman, our mother was able 
to give birth to the four of us, who now apparently are the terton's lineage. Do we 
have any cause to complain about our lot in life? This is all thanks to our mother. I 
feel one hundred percent certain that she was an emanation of Vajrapani, without 

a flicker of doubt~ 
Then, turning to Uncle Tersey, my father joined in: "In your opinion, would it 

be possible to fall into the hell realms after you have had three visions of Tara? If 
you do, then it would mean that noble Tara has no blessings. Also, many times I 
put grains of barley that my mother had blessed into small bags and gave them 
to people for protection. When these were hung around the necks of goats and 
sheep, the animals were immune to bullets. This happened more than once! Could 
anyone with such blessings be reborn in hell? Or are you saying that our mother 
has no power of blessing? 

"Of course, what you say about the extreme subtlety of the law of karma is true, 
but, just between us, don't include our mother among ordinary beings~ 

From the side, a deep voice was heard saying, "That's true-those are my thoughts 
exactlY: It was Uncle Sang-Ngak. "I don't feel mother will be in any trouble. The 
workings of karma are subtle, to be sure, so what do I really know? Nevertheless, 



Grandmother's Death 201 

.lwas her main attendant and what I saw of her in these last few years may not be 
me mother you think you remember. I swear she had gone totally beyond the state 
~delusion. I know this from my own experience: she had become quite sponta-
neous and uncontrived; she stopped discriminating between different qualities of 
bod. No matter what happened, she didn't have a single objection-everything 
''25 fine. I am certain that she was no longer like an ordinary human being~ 

Again Sam-ten Gyatso spoke, ·rm the one who gave her mind teachings. She 
~the daughter of the great terton, and true enough when she grew up, she got 
a-~ried to a young man of the Tsangsar family and was caught up in worldly re-
sponsibilities. Then the four of us were born, with all the distractions that entails. 

'Later, it fell to me to do my best to point out the nature of mind to her. But, 
aiilike an ordinary person, she recognized it before I had even finished. She made 
steady progress every year, every month, every single day. Four or five years ago, 
she changed completely: she transcended any moment of delusion, whether day or 
night. She explained this to me very clearly. As you know, our mother was no liar. 
She told me, 'I no longer get distracted during the day or night. I do, however, get 
a short period of uncertainty between falling asleep and beginning to dream: 

'What you call 'the subtle working of karma' is dependent upon conceptual 
ihinking; someone like her, whose awareness is undistracted, is no longer caught 
1 

'up in thoughts. Isn't samsara the magical play of the thinking mind? Isn't it an illu-
~n? How can I think for even a moment that someone beyond distraction could 
I 

bJl into the lower realms? 
'Moreover, you could say that our mother had attained perfect recall. Think 

·~ut it: she didn't forget a single word, no matter what you told her. Couldn't she 
retell every single event she had witnessed, down to the finest detail? It's quite dif-
6cult to give an eyewitness account with that kind of detail. 

'Wasn't she also the one who had the final say in the tradition of torma mak-
ing, as well as the fine art of ritual trumpet playing? Compare her style to that of 
monks nowadays-she carried on the authentic art. Who around here has a better 
Calligraphic hand than she mastered while at Mindrolling with her father? Wasn't 
~e also a healer with medicinal herbs? And didn't she know astrology? Wasn't it 
our mother whom we turned to for advice on all matters? No matter how much I 
think about her, I find no need to worry. 
· "You are worried about the law of karma, but isn't samadhi the remedy against 

~it? \\:'hen these two cross swords, we all know that one is relative and the other 
ultimate. When has it ever been the case that relative phenomena win out over the 
ultimate nature? Can the clouds conquer the sky? Think about it, Tersey!• 

As always, Sam ten Gyatso spoke very convincingly. 



202 EARLY YEARS 

•It is so,• Uncle Sang-Ngak added. ·over the last couple of years, I too hm 
noticed that she didn't hold any selfish notions. This must be what they call the 
collapse of delusion. She accepted everything as it was:' 

I was sitting there quietly and heard it all with my own ears. When telling yoa 
this today, I haven't added or distorted anything they said.••• 

Extensive ceremonies for grandmother were performed for the tradition~ 
forty-nine days, and at their completion a cremation stupa was built on the large 
meadow in front of Tsikey Gompa. Karsey Kongtrul was asked to preside over 
the funeral ceremony, but his health was not very good at that time and for a 
while it was uncertain whether he would be able to. When Karsey Kongtrul fi. 
nally arrived, I was appointed his private attendant. Sometimes I snuck into his 
room in the evening and sat with him in silence. Even though other people were 
pres~nt, the atmosphere wasn't one in which you could just blabber in needless 
conversation. 

At the ceremony many lamas, including the previous Dzigar Kongtrul, were 
seated in the four cardinal directions. There were also a great number of monks 
and lay practitioners-so many, in fact, that the area around the funeral stupa 
resembled a crowded marketplace. Karsey Kongtrul himself oversaw the central 
funeral ritual. 

There was an auspiciously clear blue sky and many extraordinary signs such 
as streams of rainbow light. When we opened the cremation stupa, many of 
the bones were filled with crimson-colored sindhura powder. Karsey Kongtrul 
kept one of the bones. On another was a small self-appeared image of the dakini 
Sangwa Yeshe. Dzongsar Khyentse and other masters considered this image very 
precious. This bone was kept by Dzigar Kongtrul in a special reliquary made of 
fine sandalwood. 

According to Tibetan custom, each of Konchok Paldron's descendants was 
given one of her most prized possessions as a sacred heirloom. Penjik received 
the personal rosary of the second Karmapa, made of the finest jade. I inherited 
a small piece of yellow parchment containing dakini script that was about the 
width of four fingers, which Chokgyur Lingpa had found as a terma. I'm not 
very good at keeping track of my belongings though. After a while, afraid that! 
might lose it, I felt that this yellow parchment would be safer in Uncle Tersey~ 
hands. 

Once, Dzongsar Khyentse was traveling through Neten, on his way to Central 
Tibet. My aunt Tashi Chimey, who had great faith in him, found a chance for them 



Grandmother's Death 203 

to talk in private. I heard about this from Dzongsar Khyentse's attendant, who fol-
~wed him for many years and later died in Sikkim. 

My aunt offered Dzongsar Khyentse some hair and a rosary that had belonged 
toKonchok Paldron. Dzongsar Khyentse placed them on the top of his head for a 
komenl He told his attendant he had just received something extremely precious 
ihat he would place in his special chest of relics. 

After she left, the master said to his attendants, "Tashi Chimey, Konchok 
Paldron's daughter, came to present her understanding to me today and it was 
quite impressive. She has a remarkable level of experience and realization. She 
'told me, 'I am just the caretaker. I have many daily tasks and my meditation state is 
'neither lofty nor placid. I don't dwell in a state of quietude. My state is one of being 
totally lucid and awake without clinging to anything whatsoever. 
:•when you look at me: she added, 'you see this old woman going about her 

bUsiness, just being a servant-don't you? But I'm not like that at all. I was intro-
duced to the awakened state a long time ago. I don't have to try to keep still as if 
afraid my cup might spill. I'm not afraid of that at all: 
:"She continued, 'My awareness is one of being totally present and awake. I am 

net like others: busy keeping a serene countenance with a vacant state of mind. As 
a matter of fact, I don't see any need for that. My mind is wide open. I see other 
meditators so anxious and worried that their equanimity may be disturbed. How 
can fear maintain the true state of samadhi? Isn't meditation meant for transcend-
mg the three realms of samsara? How can one be free while still afraid of losing 
emptiness? How can emptiness be lost, anyway? .. 

That's the sort of thing she would say. Later that day, Dzongsar Khyentse re-
marked, ·or course, Tashi Chimey's mother was a realized meditator, but it ap-.. 
pears that the daughter made quite good progress herself-don't you think?.

The Colorful 
Chokling ofTsikey 

Tsikey Chokling was not only incredibly bright and ingenious but also famous 
and influential, as well as quite savvy politically. He was well known for his ability 
to settle disputes, though if he were your opponent in one, you wouldn't stand a 
chance. He was incredibly self-confident and had an impressive, dignified bearing. 
as if there were no one above him. His was a very dominating presence. 

Tsikey Chokling's eyes were like those of no one else 1 have ever met-very 
bright and clear. Most people couldn't bear his gaze for more than a short while. 
He was also very handsome and I felt that as a young man he must have looked 
almost like a god. 

1 found him simply astounding! 
Once there was a political dispute between the Tibetan government and the 

Chinese province to the east of I<ham, and he acted as the mediator. Both sides 
gave him a specific high political rank with the accompanying brocade robes and 
insignia. The problem was serious enough that it could have led to a major con· 
flict; but thanks to his discriminating intelligence and self-assurance, he managed 
to resolve the dispute and avoid a war. •64 

The great I<hyentse and Kongtrul had already passed away while TsikeyChokling 
was still a youth and, of the old generation of masters, only Karmey Khenpo re-
mained. Due to differences in their personalities, I'm not sure how much Tsikey 
Chokling and Karmey Khenpo connected. In the end, it was Samten Gyatso who 
pointed out self-existing awareness in its naked state so that Tsikey Chokling rec-
ognized it in actuality. Therefore, in the last part of his life, he regarded Samten 
Gyatso as his one and only root guru, and trusted him with unwavering faith. 
Samten Gyatso was the younger of the two, but that didn't seem to matter-he still 
asked Samten Gyatso for teachings. 

Tsikey Chokling was not in the habit of placing himself below other mas-
ters. •1 don't bow to just any lama who happens by: he would say, ·except for the 



The Colorful Clwkling ofTsikey 205 

Karmapa~ The rare occasion when he could be seen prostrating was when Samten 
Gratso was around. 

At that time, Tsikey Chokling had almost the same rank and position as the 
Karmapa, and he never asked other lamas to put their hand on his head to give 
him a blessing. Whenever other masters-no matter how revered-arrived, he 
would treat them as his equal. But despite his own high spiritual rank, he refused 
to_ sit higher than Samten Gyatso. The sole exception was on visits to his teacher's 
monastery, where he was forced to sit on the main throne. Sam ten Gyatso, for his 
part, showed Tsikey Chokling immense respect. 
, Unlike Chokgyur Lingpa himself, it wasn't Tsikey Chokling's style to give teach-

ings and empowerments, although he did give me a few short instructions on the 
nature of mind. 

Near the end of his life, Tsikey Chokling didn't act like a normal person but 
instead would behave with complete childlike innocence. He almost never said 
a single word unless asked. He never initiated anything except as a response, but 
once he did, he did so beautifully. For instance, he would sit motionless and never 
lift his cup to his lips unless you said, •Rinpoche, please have some tea; and then 
lie would take a sip. Or if a visitor came, he would simply sit there until I said, 
;Rinpoche, there is a visitor-please talk to him:" Then he would say, ·oh yeah• 
and start to talk. 

No one was quite sure whether he was in a state of samadhi, had transcended 
d~usion, or had had a stroke-and the master himself surely didn't comment on 
t But even when he was ill, he didn't seem to be suffering any pain. As a matter of 
fact, it is difficult to find an adequate description for him. 

Since he was quite old and not that well, he had asked my father if Penjik or I 
could come to Tsikey to look after him. Penjik was already a ponpo, a local lord, 
but since Tsikey Chokling insisted, Samten Gyatso finally gave permission for me 
lD go. "The lama is really old,• Sam ten Gyatso told my father, ·so let's let him have 

· bisway~ 
I stayed with Tsikey Chokling for about six months as his attendant and nurse. 

We got along quite well; we were very fond of each other and I gladly did whatever 
·heasked me to. I had some good times with him over those months. 

One of my jobs was to entertain him and to keep him from falling asleep. Since 
!was good at modeling tsampa dough, I sometimes made sculptures of his head 
He had a particularly striking profile and seeing his own big nose caused him to 
burst out laughing in a deep, loud voice. 

I was pretty good at keeping people awake. 



206 EARLY YEARS 

Tsikey Chokling told me many stories in his own down-to-earth style-no ex-
aggerations, just the plain facts. 

Apparently, he had many visions as he told mt! scvt!ral stories from his visit 1D 
Padmasambhava's pure land where he even met the Lotus-Born master in persort~>~~ 

Once when we went for a picnic by the river, he told me, ·They say Samten 
Gyatso is an emanation of Four-Armed Mahakala and I think that is quite apt" 

•Why do you say that?• I asked. 
Then he told me about a vision in which he visited the Glorious Copper-Colored 

Mountain, the pure land of Padmasambhava; he even described the layout oftlr 
outer and inner walls.'66 In each of the four directions of the central palace, then 
was a stupa and one of them contained an amazing stone with a naturally formlll 
mandala depicting the forty-two peaceful deities carved on its surface. Anyone 
entering the Glorious Copper-Colored Mountain had to walk through the based 
this stupa, hence purifying their cognitive obscurations. 

As Tsikey Chokling approached the stupa, he came to the boulder with tlr 
imprints of Padmasambhava's hands and feet. As he was leaving, he noticed thi 
to the right of the stupa there was a cave in the face of the mountain and he asked 
the gatekeeper whose cave it was. 

•This is the cave of Four-Armed Mahakala; the gatekeeper replied. 
•1 must meet him; Tsikey Chokling said, but he was told that Mahakala wasn\ 

there, though his consort Dusolma was. In the cave he saw Dusolma, the femai 
guardian of the teachings; beside her was a vacant lotus seat. 

When Tsikey Chokling looked down at the lotus seat, he saw Samten Gyatso's 
knife lying there. Throughout his life, Sam ten Gyatso carried this particular knifE· 
Since he was a vegetarian, it wasn't the normal dagger Khampas wear to cut~ 
meat, but a small knife he always kept on his belt. 

·Hey!• Tsikey Chokling exclaimed. •What's Sam ten Gyatso's knife doing heret 
·why don't you just look down and see?· Dusolma replied. 
As Tsikey Chokling turned around and looked down upon our world-whidt 

he could do since this was a vision-he zoomed in on Kham and saw Samtell 
Gyatso's shining bald head there in his monastery. 

•The Four-Armed Mahakala is right down there; Dusolma continued. "Can\ 
you see him? Don't you know who he is?• 

Tsikey Chokling scanned throughout the entire region of Tsikey and the reSt 
of eastern Tibet. Finally he said, •1 don't see any Mahakala, only Samten GyatsO,' 
Chokgyur Lingpa's grandnephew:' 

·That's him; Dusolma said. ·oon't you know that knife is Mahakala's cumd 
cleaver?• 



11te Colorful Clwkling ofTsikey 207 

Tsikey Chokling thought to himself, ·Now I know why he always carries that 

r.tle knife." 

In another vision, Tsikey Chokling saw that Sam ten Gyatso was also an em-
mation of Vimalamitra, the Indian master of unparalleled importance in the 
Dwgchen lineage. ' 67 From this vision, he wrote down a mind treasure, a small vol-
ume of texts including a sadhana revealing the magical nature of Sam ten Gyatso's 

present incarnation, the story of his spiritual realization, pith instructions and 
other details. He kept this book hidden in his coat, never parting from it and using 

~in his daily practice. 
Now it happens that the great Khyentse had told Chokgyur Lingpa to establish 

his seat at the place where the Tsichu and Kechu rivers join- hence the name 

Tsikey, where the monastery was built. It was also prophesied to be a sacred place 
rontaining the extraordinary terma treasure Spontaneous Fulfillment of Wishes. 
Up the river are some naturally formed hot springs, and often people would trek 
there and spend a week recuperating in the warm water. 
_On one occasion, Tsikey Chokling, along with my precious grandmother, 

Samten Gyatso, Uncle Tersey and some officials from Tsikey headed up to the hot

springs. They pitched tents along the riverbank and the lamas went to bathe in the 
hot pools. As Tsikey Chokling was taking his clothes off. he carefully wrapped up 
his book inside his robes. Wearing only his yogi shorts he entered the hot pool As. 
Tsikey Chokling was getting out of the water, Sam ten Gyatso walked over to get 
him his clothes and when he picked them up, the book fell out. 

One of Sam ten Gyatso's traits was that he couldn't leave a Buddhist scripture 

alone without scanning its contents. ' 61 As soon as he saw the book, he began to 
unwrap it. 

·u he sees the text, he might destroy it: Tsikey Chokling thought. ·1 must keep 
it from him!• 

So he yelled, •Give that to me! Hand it over! You don't need to unwrap it!" 

This triggered Samten Gyatso's suspicion. •sure 111 give it to you: he replied. 
·Just let me take a glance first.• 

Sam ten Gyatso read the title, flipped the page and continued to read how he 

himself was supposed to be an emanation of Vimalamitra; there was even an ac-
companying guru sadhana, complete with the subtle tantric stages of development 
and completion. 

Instead of getting his book back, Tsikey Chokling got a severe scolding. "You 
are supposed to be a reincarnation of Chokgyur Lingpa-at least according to 

the great Khyentse-and until today 1 had absolute faith that this was true.l was 
counting on you to uphold the New Treasures for the benefit of the Dharma and 
all sentient beings. But now, when I look at these scribbles of yours, 1 see that you 

are a charlatan through and through, a deceiver of other people, an outright liar! 
What a disgrace to the Dharma! Swear to me that from this day on you will never 
again succumb to writing down such pretentious nonsense!" 

Samten Gyatso immediately marched to the broad and turbulent Kechu River 
and flung the book out into the churning waters. 

Samten Gyatso wasn't done berating Tsikey Chokling however and continued, 
•you're making this old monk, who is completely devoid of any qualities, into 

· something he's not! What a preposterous fraud! If you are going to act like this, 
there is no benefit in your being the tulku of Chokgyur Lingpa. From now on, 

don't do anything that will damage our sacred bond." 

After that, Sam ten Gyatso never mentioned a single word about it. 
As you can see, Samten Gyatso was committ~d to the lifestyle of a hidden 

yogi. Vajrayana in general should be kept private-doing so increases rather than 
decreases virtues. The same holds true for the personal qualities of a yogi. The 
moment a special ability is announced, worldly people will ~ee it as nothing but 
an attempt to aggrandize oneself. If we truly care about the well-being of others, 



11re Colorful Chokling ofTsikey 209 

v.·e should not give them the least pretext to think such negative thoughts about 
Vajrayana and its practitioners. 

Even though someone like me can't see these things, I have simple-minded faith 
that Samten Gyatso's sentiment still doesn't change the facts: Tsikey Chokling 
did reveal a mind treasure showing that Samten Gyatso was Vimalamitra in 
person. 

In a very matter-of-fact manner, Tsikey Chokling later told me, •There was 
much more detail in that mind treasure I could have written down. Sam ten Gyatso 
really was Vimalamitra in human form, but he forbade me ever to speak another 
ll"Ord about that:' 

Uncle Tersey and Tsikey Chokling shared the same monastery. At times-acting 
as though his pure perception had slipped for a moment-my uncle commented 
·,.;th his usual tongue-in-cheek humor on how ·cunning• this tulku of Chokgyur 
Ungpa was. He would say, •tsikey Chokling is very clever and audacious in pre-
senting a legal case-but he's also a skilled liar. When we are together, he makes 
up fantastic storit>s; he exaggerates and embellishes the facts. Sometimes l wonder 
how an incarnation of Chokgyur Lingpa could be so involved in worldly affairs. 
But on the other hand, the great Khyentse couldn't be wrong:' 

Tsikey Chokling had in fact been given a letter of recognition in the great 
Kh)·entse's own hand and bearing Khyentse's personal seal, a sign he truly was an 
incarnation of Chokgyur Lingpa. 
·Uncle Tersey would often speak in a playful, even outrageous manner. He would 

continue, ·since l have spent so many years with him, I know his level of experi-
ence and meditation. As he grows older, his realization becomes obvious-such 
depth surprises me. Often he reveals his clairvoyant powers. This is why I have 
~eat trust in him. 

"As a noble incarnation, he ought to be replete with perfect qualities. But every 
now and then he appears to be so full of political scheming. His sharp tongue en-
lures that he always comes out on top in any situation. Sometimes, I wonder who 
he really is-he's so bold and daring that I think he might be better off as a general 
in the army. Or maybe he's simply the incarnation of a demon:' 

Uncle Tersey would burst out laughing. 
Then he'd start up again: ·our Rinpoche's so tall and handsome and has such a 

commanding presence that when he walks into a group, no one has the least doubt 
·about which one is Chokgyur Lingpa's tulku. He's a great bodhisattva, endowed 
with all the qualities, free of all faults. But then, at second glance, doesn't he delight 



210 EARLY YEARS 

in fighting court cases to help friends and subdue enemies? And he's so good at it 
no ordinary person can outdo him. Spiritual and secular aims are supposed to be 
contradictory-even the Buddha gave one up for the other!• 

Again we had to laugh with my uncle. 
·or course, I have no doubt in him: Uncle Tersey would finish. •It's simply that 

every now and again these thoughts slip into my mind~ 
The truth is that these two lamas were very close, sharing everything. Uncle 

Tersey had deep trust in Tsikey Chokling, which made his remarks so much· 
funnier. 

One time Tsikey Chokling told me an odd story about what it means to have 
confidence in the view. 

There was an old lama, the bursar in a small monastery, who had only spent the 
last few months of his life in retreat. He was lying on his deathbed and called on 
Tsikey Chokling, who was often asked to give a final instruction or empowerment 
when someone was about to die. 

•you are the reincarnation of Chokgyur Lingpa: the old man began, ·so I have 
something special to ask you. It's not the normal type of request; you have to make 
me a promise~ 

Tsikey Choking thought, ·Poor old guy! People get so afraid on the verge of 
death, and they think that in the final moment there is still time to change their 
entire life. Here's another one, scared out of his wits, afraid of going to the lowei 
realms. But how can I promise him that his evil deeds won't drag him down into 
the lower realms? Perhaps he should have begun his recitations and meditation 
much earlier in life~ 

But to the monk he just said, •Tell me what you want~ 
•Before I tell you, you must promise to say yes. Only then will I tell you!· 
Tsikey Chokling replied, •you tell me first, then I'll decide!• 
The dying lama continued to argue his point until Tsikey Chokling finally had 

to agree. 
•I have no other wish than this. We all know that the three lower realms are 

horrifying, especially the eighteen regions of hell. '159 Isn't the lowest of these the 
Hell of Incessant Torment? And below that isn't there the dreaded Vajra Hell? 
That's where 1 want to go. Please lama, send me straight there the moment I die. 
That's what you must promise me you will do!• 

•Why in the world would you want to go there?· asked Tsikey Chokling, ·"'hy 
do you need my help to go there?· 



Tlze Colorful Chokling ofTsikey 211 

"Without your help and blessing, I cannot possibly end up there by myself,' the 
old lama replied. ·unless I am sent there by someone with special powers, it's not 
plissible. By myself I have already visited the eighteen hell realms from time to 
lime. But I just can't seem to get all the way down to Vajra Hell. So you, the tulku 
o£Chokgyur Lingpa, must help me!• 

Tsikey Chokling later told me, •That old guy really had confidence in the view; 
hfwas completely without fear. He died soon after, and I have yet to meet anyone 
with that level of courage. Every other dying person I have visited asked me for 
blessings to escape this and be free from that. One person even asked me to make 
mre he attained complete enlightenment, but no one else has ever asked to be sent 
to hell, least of all Vajra Hell. 

"I was very impressed with that old lama; he added. •As a matter of fact, I 
gained some faith in him. Of my own accord, I returned to attend his cremation. 
lsawwith my own eyes that his ashes were unusually full of relic pills. During the 
aemation, we all saw lots of rainbows from the funeral pyre;" 
· • What this all means is that the old lama had totally transcended both hope 
and fear. Once someone has realized the original wakefulness of dharmakaya, the 
.klwer realms are no longer a threat, and the prospect of enlightenment in some 
other place is no longer seen as a promise, since he or she is already awakened 
within the inner space of primordial purity.'70 Such a person stands on the verge 
of attaining complete enlightenment at the moment of death. So is there anything 
to be afraid of then? 

Someone who has attained the fourfold confidence mentioned in the Dzogchen 
teachings'7' has also attained stability in the awakened state. So there is no yearn-
ing for liberation in some other place and no dread of a low rebirth in samsara. 
That is the meaning of transcending hope and fear. At that point, even if you try, 
you can't be reborn anywhere near the hell realms through the force of negative 
brma. So when someone attains mastery in nondual awareness, there is no way 
he can fall into Vajra Hell-and I doubt Tsikey Chokling had any luck in sending 
him there either. an 

Near the end of his life, it was obvious that Tsikey Chokling was clairvoyant. 
He even told me where he would be reborn: in the Yarlung valley in Central 
libetan 

He said, ·oespite all my roaming about, I never managed to visit Yarlung. Now 
my mind is attached to that place, so I am bound to take rebirth there. But I do so 
happily; I have wished so many times to be in Yarlung. 



212 EARLY YEARS 

·For a while; he added, •I have imagined that my surroundings here are Yarlung. 
I even find myself believing that this Kechu River is the river in Yarlung. As a 
young man, I had the habit of living in tents and I enjoy that, so now I will camp by 
the river in my little Yarlung. I imagine it to be Yarlung; I meditate on it as Yarlung. 
That is where I want to stay:" 

The Kechu isn't a small river; neither horses nor yaks can cross it, only large 
boats. Tsikey Chokling held a very high position; he owned a tremendous amount 
of land, equal to that of the Karmapa-and so when he moved to the tent, about 
fifty officials and attendants had to accompany him. 

Later I heard that he actually moved into his tent and stayed by the river for two 
or three months. 

One day I got a message that Tentrul, one of the important lamas at Surmang 
monastery, had invited Sam ten Gyatso there to give the transmission of Chokgyur 
Lingpa's New Treasures, and my presence was required. I wanted to remain with 
Tsikey Chokling, especially when he told me, ·u you leave now, we won't meet 
again,· adding, ·but neither of us has a choice in the matter. You must go andre-
ceive the New Treasures:" 

I was well down the road when I suddenly heard his voice booming behind me, 
•Tutku!· So I went back to him and asked, ·Yes, Rinpoche?'" He just sat there with 
his big eyes wide open, not saying a word. So I slowly backed out of his presence 
and again began my journey to Surman g. I was almost out of earshot when a sec· 
ond time I heard his voice calling, •Hey, tulku!· 

How could I dare just keep walking? So I walked all the way back to him and 
again asked, •yes, Rinpoche what is it?'" 

But he just sat there silently with open eyes. This scene was played out about 
six times. 

I got a strong sense that this was not the right time to leave and that he was not~ 
ally giving me permission to go. Yet on the other hand, my father and Samten Gyatso 
were waiting down at Surmang and had sent for me to come as soon as possible. 

I remember that each time I was able to get farther and farther away before he 
called me back, until I finally vanished from sight. 

I never saw him again. 

Tsikey Chokling's next rebirth was recognized by the Karmapa in a piece of 
poetry beginning with these words: 



Tlte Colorful Chokling ofTsikey 213 

"In the upper end of the Yarlung valley, near the Tramdruk Temple, ' 74 he is 
born in a noble family of moderate income. His father is Powerful Merit, while his 
mother is Bountiful Longevity. He is the youngest of three siblings.· 

The poetry concluded with the year and month of his birth, as well as which 
oonstellation would be in the sk-y at the time. Never has it been so easy to find a 
tull:u. To top it off, the first thing the child said upon the arrival of the search party 
ll"aS, -¥ou must have come to fetch me~ There was absolutely no doubt that this 
was the tulku. This tulku was beautiful, like a child of the gods. 

The young Tsikey tulku was enthroned at Tsurphu by the Karmapa, and then 
also by Reding, the Tibetan regent, with whom he had a special connection from 
the past. The regent gave the tulku a famous image of the Lotus-Born known as 
Guru Mahasukha and the helmet of Machen Pomra, one of the most important 
guardian spirits of Tibet. He very affectionately kept the tulku on his lap, and let 
him play with some of his sets of vajras and bells, one of which had belonged to 
the great Khyentse. There were several sets and he asked the little tulku if he rec-
ognized any of them. 

"I recognize this; the little boy said pointing to one. •That's the one!· And sure 
enough, it had been his. He was invited to Kham when he was but a teenager. 
One time he stayed for six months in the monastic college at Dzongsar. During 
this short time, he would teach Shantideva's Way of a Bodhisattva from memory. 
He was bright and very well-spoken. He also learned a rare form of calligraphy, 
and in his spare time he copied out eight or nine large volumes of scriptures in a 
beautiful hand. 

After arriving in Kham, he received a request from the family of an old lama 
who was near death. The lama was from an influential family who would give hun-
dreds of cattle and horses to the monasteries of the region each year.'75 This lama 
ll'aS regarded as the most important disciple of the past Tsikey Chokling. 

When the bursar told the tulku of the request, he refused outright. •1 definitely 
llill not go; he protested. •That's all there is to it. It's not going to happen~ 

But some people don't know when to stop-the lama's family was adamant. In 
addition, the tulku's monastic household also insisted, •This lama was so dose to 
JOur previous life that you are obligated~ 
:Before departing, the tulku went into Uncle Tersey's quarters, as was the tradi-

tion before taking leave. Here again he said, •1 really don't want to go~ 
Uncle Tersey replied, ·u everyone in the monastery has formed an opinion, 

what good is my word? I'm not telling you that you should go, but it also appears 
that I cannot prevent it~ 



214 EARLY YEARS 

·rm not going! I'm not going!· The tulku again repeated; he even started to cry. 
But everyone else was set to leave, and they came to fetch him. 

His parting words to Uncle Tersey were, •If I take this journey, we won't meet 
again!· The boy was just a teenager, but somehow he knew-more so than Uncle 
Tersey, who always said that he could only see dense darkness rather than clair· 
voyance. 

The real problem here was entangled with the responsibilities of running a large 
monastery, where many people need to be fed on a daily basis. Connections with 
wealthy households must be maintained. So sometimes concerns for prominence 
and material gain take precedence. These were actually the compelling reasons. 

The journey to the lama's family as well as the cremation ceremonies all went 
well. The offerings given to the monastery and to Tsikey were indeed lavish. It was 
on the return journey that disaster struck. 

As they were passing through a valley, they received news that a dignitary re-
siding there had suddenly died. He was known as a diehard liar and perpetrator of 
many a crime. Upon hearing that Tsikey Chokling and his entourage were passing 
through, the family came to beseech them to preside over yet another cremation. 

•1 will neither go there nor perform any ceremony for that man!· the tulku 
responded. 

·But Rinpoche; they begged, •it is so close, it's not even out of your way!• 
Again a major argument ensued and again the managers of the monastery got 

their way. The tulku performed the purification for the departed spirit and the 
funeral pyre was lit. 

The first time the smoke blew in the tulku's direction, he suddenly cried out in 
pain. Those seated closest to him could see a boil forming on his throat. The tulku 
appeared in constant agony from then on. The boil opened soon after and by the 
next morning you could see the vertebrae in his neck. He passed away soon after. 

When the party arrived back at Tsikey, his horse was carrying his corpse,leav· 
ing everyone in shock. Uncle Tersey in particular was extremely saddened, not 
only by the tulku's death but especially because he was so young and it seemed 
like such a waste.

Transmission at Surmang 

Within the Karma Kagyu lineage, there are two additional branches known as 
S:mnang and Nendo, both of which had major monastic centers. Tentrul was 
one of the great masters of Surmang; he was also counted among the ten ma-
;or Dharma heirs of Chokgyur Lingpa. He was an extremely important master, 
learned in both Sutra and Tantra. 

The current Tentrul had invited Sam ten Gyatso to one of the Surmang branch 
monasterie!\, where he personally sponsored the transmission of the New Treasures. 
Many learned masters had gathered at Surmang for this event, including eighteen 
major lamas and tulkus from Kham. 

Honestly, it's hard to find a match for the quality of the lamas at Surmang among 
the Kagyu lineages. There were around nine hundred fully ordained monks, plus 
three hundred more in the monastic college. Many were quite learned. Twice a 
month, on the tenth and twenty-fifth of the lunar calendar, Sam ten Gyatso would 
give a talk for all of them. Several of the khenpos would also give impressive 
speeches, one after the other. 

Also present was Dzigar Kongtrul, the former incarnation of the Dzigar 
Kongtrul that you know today. He was renowned throughout Derge for having 
a tongue ·as sharp as a knife cutting water· -his eloquence was unimpeded. 
When his turn came to give a speech, it was remarkable. He would insert ver-
batim quotes from all the scriptures without a moment's hesitation, astounding 
everyone. 

For three straight months, my father and uncle worked in tandem: in the morn-
ings, Samten Gyatso performed the empowerment preparations, while my father 
gave the reading transmission. In the afternoons, Sam ten Gyatso would give the 
empowerments in the large assembly hall. 

In the beginning, Samten Gyatso made me a shrine attendant, together with 
Dudul and another monk. But after a while, my father said, ·u you run around like 



216 EARLY YEARS 

that between the lama and the shrine, you are going to miss some of the transmis-
sions. I'll try to find a way to ask Sam ten Gyatso if you can he excused.· 

I knew that even my father was intimidated by Samten Gyatso, and so I told 
him, •1 feel 1 am getting the empowerments in this way. Better not to say any-
thing-I'm fine.· 

But my father did bring it up, and Samten Gyatso agreed. 1 was excused from 
my duties. For the rest of the New Treasures I could simply sit and receive the 
teachings in the company of the outstanding masters assembled at Surman g. 

Near the end of the three months Sam ten Gyatso said to Tentrul, ·The learned 
lamas among you understand and appreciate the nature of the New Treasures: 
Starting tomorrow morning, I will begin giving the restricted empowerments.'~ 
1 am not here to promote myself, nor will I give the secret empowerments in· 
discriminately. I've noticed that some self-important officials and arrogant bene-: 
factors have joined the gathering, but from tomorrow their presence will not be 
welcome. Tentrul, it is your duty to decide who will be allowed to attend and who 
will not:" 

That day, at the end of the gathering, Tentrul announced that from then on not 
a single layperson would be allowed, only lamas and ordained monks. 

The next morning, however, there was a curtain hanging at the back of one of 
the lamas' thrones; behind it sat various local dignitaries and officials. They pre-
tended not to be there; such people from Surmang were known for their brazen-
ness. 

Usually, at the end of an empowerment, the lamas would come to the front and 
receive the blessings with ritual implements from Samten Gyatso in person, after 
which the blessed objects would be carried around the gathering. That day, how-
ever, Samten Gyatso simply remained seated on the throne, motionless. 

After a heavy silence, he proclaimed, •1 have heard that the ruling class around 
Surmang is very brave. Isn't that what you tell me? But the great bravery of the 
Surmang upper class is no reason for me to throw Chokgyur Lingpa's termas to 
the wind. This old monk doesn't have to obey any local YIPs; the only people I 
must obey are my root gurus. I said I would pass on the transmission to lamas and 
ordained monks, but not to worldly people. This is what I told Tentrul yesterday 
and that is what he announced to all of you. But tell me-isn't it true that behind 
that curtain over there, fifty worldly people have crept in? So today is the last day. 
1 am leaving, so the empowerments end here:" 



Transmission at Surma11g 217 

This scolding shocked everyone, and the assembly hall went dead quiet. Sam ten 
Gyatso told his shrine assistants to start packing up, and everyone filed out except 
for me. my father and my cousin Karmey Khentrul. 

Tentrul also remained behind and called my father over to the throne where 
he sat •you're his brother. You have to tell Sam ten Gyatso that if I allow this to 
happen and don't correct it before the day is out, I will become a samaya violator. 
)sincerely appreciate the close lineage of the New Treasures.• As a matter of fact, 
centuries before, the Lotus-Born master had prophesied that this very Surmang 
Tentrul would one day be one of the ten major lineage holders. 

"I have arranged for this event out of concern for the Buddha's teachings and 
sentient beings, and out of pure aspirations,· Tentrul continued. •I deeply regret 
the present turn of events. It appears I have broken the guru's command. Please 
ask him to reconsider and, after a three-day break, to bestow the rest of the trans-
missions upon us. At that time I will personally enforce his wish strictly~ 

When Chimey Dorje delivered the message, Samten Gyatso was adamant. 
'Absolutely not! How can I freely hand out the profound terma teachings from 
.which the warm breath of the dakinis has still not disappeared?•an 

Since he had great respect for Tentrul, yet was also quite mild-mannered, my 
other was in a tough spot. Luckily, Karmey Khenlrul had more guts, and so he was 
asked to break the bad news to Tentrul. Heartbroken, Tentrul began to weep. 

Samten Gyatso heard him and asked, •What is he doing?• I told him that Tentrul 
was crying and asked what we should do. 
~He delegated what he should have done himself;' Samten Gyatso said. ·He 

ne~ected to keep out those pushy dignitaries. How can I give the precious terma 
teachings to such self-important people? Anyway, it doesn't matter what he says 
now, I'm packing up!• 

Undaunted, Karmey Khentrul again approached, asking, ·uncle, what's the use 
of interrupting the empowerments? You need to finish what you started. You can't 
lea\'e a great master like Tentrul stranded:" 

"Nonsense; was all Samten Gyatso replied, dismissively. Then my father began 
to mediate, going back and forth between his brother and Tentrul. All the while, 
Dudul and the other shrine attendant were standing outside the door, preventing 
anyone from entering. 

"He must forgive me today; Tentrul implored. ·otherwise I refuse to eat or 
deep~ 

"Why is he still sitting here?· Samten Gyatso snapped. I told him what Tentrul 
had said, since my father didn't dare repeat it. •He says he won't sleep at night or 
eat during the day unless you forgive him:" 



218 EARLY YEARS 

•How's that going to help?• my uncle replied. •AIJ he'd be doing is making his 
own life miserable. Blackmail like that shouldn't occur between master and dis· 
ciple~ 

This went on until Sam ten Gyatso finally yielded, saying, •Fine! Tell him it's all 
right, he can leave now~ 

That was one tough day! And for five days afterward, the monks and lamas 
performed a feast offering with thousands and thousands of tormas as part of a 
formal ceremony to heal the rift. The empowerments then continued, but in a very 
somber atmosphere. 

As you can see, Samten Gyatso could be quite stern.

The Master in the 
Hollow Tree 

Let me tell you about the extraordinary scripture the Light of Wtsdom. This fun-
damental text by Padmasambhava reads like a poetic song. As a guidance manual 
for practice, it is strikingly clear all by itself. The Light ofWtsdom is immense in its 
scope, including virtually every aspect of the Buddhist path to enlightenment. Old 
Khyentse described it in these words, •This single volume, the size of my forearm, 
is worth more than one hundred yak-loads of scriptures~ 

Accompanying this root text is an extensive commentary by the great I<ongtruJ. 
This document is truly a mind treasure, a revelation in its own right, written in in-
~edible depth and detail-studded with abbreviations that require copious cross-
referencing to numerous other scriptures. 

In my youth, the eccentric master Jamdrak was regarded as the person to go 
tq for an explanation of the Light of Wtsdom. At the end of the root text several 
paragraphs prophesied individuals who in the future would work for the benefit 
of the Dharma and all living beings, and exactly how they would do so. The great 
Khyentse even said that Jamdrak was among those predicted eight hundred years 
llefore by the Lotus-Born master in the scripture itself . 
. : The specific activity of those prophesied was also given in the text. ·Your 
activity; Old Khyentse told Jamdrak, ·is to propagate this scripture as widely as 
· ~u can.• And so throughout his life Jamdrak gave the reading transmission of 
this text to every single person who came to see him-whether they requested 
~or not 

Once, a man came simply to pay his respects by offering a white scarf, in the 
traditional Tibetan fashion. Jamdrak asked him to sit down, then promptly began 
reading aloud the thirty-three large sheets of scripture. This dragged on for quite 
t while, and the man became restless and complained, ·But I only came to offer 
you a scarfl· 



220 EARLY YEARS 

"If you didn't want the transmission, you shouldn't have come,· Jamdrak 
snapped "Now sit down and be quiet.•171 

Having studied with the renowned masters Khyentse and Kongtrul, Jamdrak 
was extremely learned. He helped Kongtrul compile the Treasury of Precious 
Termas, a collection of the finest revelations from Padmasambhava Later, some of 
the greatest lamas of the twentieth century studied with him, including the later 
reincarnations of both Khyentse and Kongtrul. 

Before Jamdrak passed away, Samten Gyatso and my uncle Tersey sent a gifted 
khenpo to receive instructions from the old lama. Uncle Tersey had given him a 
Jetter with this request, "Please give your particular lineage of explanation on the 
Light of WISdom to this learned monk so that it will not disappear:' 

This khenpo, known as Jokyab, was renowned for his literary skills. He later 
told me that this was due to having studied the extensive biography of the Lotus· 
Born master, the Golden Garland Chronicles, when he was quite young. •I walked 
everywhere with that volume slung over my shoulder, and I asked every lama 
I came across for teachings on different passages:' In this way, he became well· 
versed in the Buddhist teachings.'79 

By the time Jokyab had set off to see him, Jamdrak was eighty-three years old 
He lived contentedly in the hollow formed by the roots of a huge tree at a remote 
hermitage way up in the mountains. The old master couldn't sit up straight, as his 
spine had curved with age. Jamdrak was not only extremely old by Tibetan stan· 
dards, but he was quite peculiar in his ways. He wore a large cotton bib around his 
neck because he tended to drool, and he never blew his nose but let it run free~. 
He couldn't care less what people thought about how he looked. He was a real 
yogi. 

He didn't wear the shirt and shawl of an ordained practitioner-just a coat fash· 
ioned out of scraps of old sheepskin, the outside patched together with different 
kinds of cloth. One of these was a large piece of exquisite brocade with a golden 
dragon design. Apparently, he had stitched this fine swatch of silk on his tattered 
robe after someone offered it to him, though it cost him a few bitter remarks from 
the manager of the nearby monastery, who hated to see such good brocade go to 
waste like that. 

Jokyab made the arduous journey-several weeks on foot and horseback-to 
Jamdrak's hermitage accompanied by a friend who was an incarnate lama. But 
once they finally arrived, Jamdrak's first words to them were, "Three years ago I 
started life-retreat:' By that he meant he'd made a commitment to remain in re· 



11ze Master in tlte Hollow Tree 221 

treat until death. •I don't teach anymore,'" he continued. ·rm far too old for that. 
F1ease don't be angry:' 

Jokyab and his friend weren't angry, but they were extremely upset. To be turned 
dvwn this way, especially after traveling such a long distance, was a huge disap-
pointment. So they kept insisting. ·come back tomorrow morning; was Jamdrak's 
only reply. 

The next morning, the old lama said, •My body is not as strong as it used to be. 
What can I do about that? Please don't be angry. But come again tomorrow morn-
ing: Jokyab and his friend were at a loss as to what to do, but there wasn't really 
cn}thing they could do. 

The following morning, Jamdrak took out Uncle Tersey's letter and touched 
it to the crown of his head in a gesture of respect. He spoke in a feeble voice, 
'Oh dear! I'm too old to teach, but this is a letter from the incarnation of the 
great terton's son. I never met the terton in person, but I was a disciple of his 
son Wangchok Dorje. This is a command from one of Chokgyur Lingpa's sons, 
so I must fulfill it. If I don't, I would be breaking the sacred commitment to my 
master:' 

Then he shook his head weakly and added, ·sut it's too much for me today. 
Come back tomorrow:' 

The next morning-this was day four-old Jamdrak took the letter out again, 
read it once more, put it on the crown of his head as before and repeated what he 
had said previously. Then he added, ·oh dear! Anyone who breaks his guru's com-
mand is sure to go to Vajra Hell. I must by all means give you this teaching, but 
honestly, it's too much for me today:' And that was it for that day. 

Jokyab returned the following morning, this time armed with the traditional 
mandala plate for requesting teachings. While he was chanting his request, the 
old master gently pulled out the letter, read it, raised it to his head and again said, 
1 must obey my guru's command, but it's too much for me today. Come back 
tomorrow.'" 

This went on every morning like clockwork. After about a month of this, 
~l1·ab's companion had had enough. •1 know we came here on the command of 
Samten Gyatso and Tersey Tulku, but this old geezer can barely talk. On top of 
that, I'm not sure he isn't senile. His vital energies are so depleted that his body is 
caving in on itself. How is he ever going to be able to teach us? Look how he eats 
his food-half of it spills down his chest! You can see what he's eaten the last sev-
eral days all over his shirt. He's turned into a child! I don't see the point in staying 
here any longer:' 



222 EARLY YEARS 

Even so, the young Jokyab convinced his friend to persevere-and the days 
went by, with no change. Sometimes, right after mumbling, •It's too much for me 
today: the old lama would simply doze off. 

When three months had passed in this way, the companion's patience ran out 
·That's it! It's totally absurd to stick around here any longer. That old lama "'ill 
never be able to teach us anything. He can barely talk! Frankly, I doubt he has long 
to live. I don't feel that we'd go against our teacher's wishes if we left now. After all, 
we've tried hard for three solid months.· 

·oo as you like, but I'm not leaving: Jok-yab replied. ·Even if it takes a year, I'm 
going to stay. How can I disobey masters like Sam ten Gyatso and Tersey Tulkur 

Together they went back to Jamdrak one last time, but it was the same old story. 
Finally, Jokyab's companion asked to be excused. 

·oh dear!· the old lama said. He didn't say to go nor did he say not to. He simply 
repeated ·oh dear!• a few more times. So the tulku offered him a white scarf as a 
formal gesture of farewell and began his journey home. 

After that, although Jamdrak still did not give the Light of Wzsdom teachings, 
the situation actually did improve. Jokyab knew another text by heart, as did 
Jamdrak: the Guhyagarbha, the Tantra on the Essence of Secrets, which is the most 
vital of all the tantras in the Old School of Tibetan Buddhism. In a casual way, the 
two of them discussed it in detail over the course of the next three months. Jokyab 
was able to clear up many difficult points and thus became quite learned on that 
tantra. •Looking back over those months: Jokyab told me, •it seemed we were 
just having a simple conversation, but I actually received an enormous number of 
detailed instructions on this precious tantra~ 

So they settled into a regular routine. Around nine each morning, the master 
. would say, •It's time to take a leak. Why don't you come along? I'll walk ahead, but 
bring my cushion to put in the sun~ . 

Jokyab would take along the large cushion-on which Jamdrak both sat and 
slept-and place it in a small meadow nearby. The old master would come bad 
from relieving himself, flop down on the cushion and simply lie there for the next 
several hours. 

•Now he's definitely not going back to the tree until lunch: Jokyab would think. 
The old yogi would lie there on his back, eyes wide open, gazing into the sky until 
it was time to eat. At noon a small monk would announce that lunch was ready. 
That's the way it went, day in and day out. 



71te Master in the Hollow Tree 223 

Every day at dusk, without fail, Jamdrak would perform a short subjugation 
ritual and throw a torma-an offering cake, which symbolized a weapon-toward 
the east. 

"Rinpoche, why do you do this every day?" Jokyab asked him. 
"Oh dear!" the master explained. "From a country in the east, an evil force will 

rise up. It will utterly and completely destroy the Buddha's teachings in this snowy 
lmd of Tibet and leave the country in pitch-black darkness. This force cannot be 
stopped, but merely trying to stop it brings more benefit than if I were to chant the 
ritual for the peaceful and wrathful deities one hundred times and light ten thou-
sand butter lamps. When I throw this torma, I imagine hitting the demon square 
~ the head. It won't help, though; no one can repel this demon. Nevertheless, 
simply by trying, I will accumulate great merit and purify obscurations on the path 
to enlightenment:' 

Still being young when I heard the story from Jokyab, 1 thought this part was 
quite strange-for in those days, I hadn't heard of Mao Tse-tung. 

By now six months had gone by, three with nothing and three with some con-
.versation and questions. 

Then Jamdrak finally began teaching on the Light ofWcsdom, spending several 
:days on the title alone. He continued teaching, without skipping a single day over 
:the next six months, covering every single detail in the text. Wherever the great 
Kongtrul had written "and so forth" in his commentary, Jamdrak would specify 
which book to pull out of the monastery's library and on which page the informa-
tion could be found. Without fail he was right . 
. ~ Once the teachings on the Light of Wisdom had begun, Jokyab would occasion-
aUy suggest, "Why don't you move over to the monastery? It would be much easier 
for us to complete all the work we must do. It's quite difficult for me to carry books 
back and forth from the library all the time:' 

Jamdrak replied, "My whole life I've never lived in a building. I am very com-
fortable in this hollow tree. U you and other lamas want to live in a monastery, go 

. ·right ahead:' 
During his time with Jamdrak, Jokyab saw many people come to visit, includ-

ing important lamas and wealthy benefactors. They often gave Jamdrak presents 
including quite expensive objects and money. Yet the old master was completely 
free of pretense with regard to these offerings. If an object happened to be beau-
tiful, he would hold it up and say, "Wow, what a lovely little gift! Thank you so 
much!" 



224 EARLY YEARS 

Then, after the person left, regardless of what he had been given, he would 
simply turn around and toss it into a box behind his seat. Huge hunks of dried 
meat, chunks of turquoise, sacks of dried cheese, bags of tsampa, priceless pieces 
of coral-all of it got mixed together. He never looked at an offering twice. 

Jokyab noticed that one of the visitors didn't dare to come in. He was a beggar, 
and it sounded like this wasn't the first time he had come. Instead, he stuck his 
head in the window. •Eh, Rinpoche! Give me some alms, won't your 

Each time this beggar came, Jamdrak would reach back, put his hand in the 
box of offerings and, without looking, grab something and hand it out the window 
with a loud, •Here you are-enjoy!" 

One day, an official from the monastery came by and saw that the beggar had 
just walked off with an exquisite golden statue. He rushed into the hollow tree and 
started to complain. 

•Rinpoche, you can't just give away things like this. Everything should be count-
ed and priced first; then you can give what is appropriate to someone like that 
guy:' 

·oh dear!" Jamdrak replied, •you want to put a price on the priceless Buddha.! 
am not able to do that:' To which the manager had no reply. 

Jamdrak turned to Jokyab and said, ·Poor fellows. They are actually very kind to 
me. I can't hold it against them-they have to cover the monastery's needs. Erst. 
the manager came and said he wanted half of all my offerings. He told me that they 
were expanding the buildings and have many expenses, and that I don't need so 
much because all I do is practice. I agreed and let them have half. Apparently it has 
turned out to be quite a lot. Now it looks as though they have grown to feel they 
own my offerings and want to count them to make sure they get their share. 

·They've offered me a room in the monastery, but I always tell them that I am 
simply an old geezer living in a tree. I'm happy here; he added with a chuckle,1>Ut 
if they want to live in a monastery surrounded by fancy statues and lots of glitter, 
let them-if that makes them happy:' 

Jokyab spent an entire year with Jamdrak in pursuit of these teachings, return· 
ing with an enormous sheaf of notes. Because he had run out of paper during 
his stay there, he had resorted to writing his notes on birch bark. When Jokyab 
came back from his mission, it looked as if he were carrying a load of wood shav· 
ings! When he untied his load, we saw that each scrap of bark had a little number 
Samten Gyatso ordered him to copy them all out in the right order, which took 
several months. 



The Master in the Hollow Tree 225 

Jokyab's notes expanded on the abbreviations and cross-references found in 
the text and clarified the difficult points. EventuaUy he compiled them into one 
remarkable volume, which is now widely used under the name Side Ornament to 
the Light of Wisdom. 

}okyab sometimes joked, "These notes are the real repository for keeping the 
Light ofW:lSdom teachings clear and alive in my mind. Without them, I would not 
be able to give a thorough explanation. This is all thanks to }amdrak~ There was 
a slightly rueful tone to his voice, for he had not had an easy time getting these 
teachings. 

)okyab later gave me an extensive series of teachings on the Light of WlSdom 
over a six-month period.,.., Sam ten Gyatso thought these teachings were so im-
portant that even he attended them. }okyab taught by first going through the root 
\'erses from beginning to end and then teaching it one more time including the 
commentary. The second time through, he added every note that he had received, 
~ch in its proper place. Without them, even the most educated teacher would 
have had a hard time finding all the references.

The king of 

26 

An Eccentric J(ing 

Sam ten Gyatso had become exceedingly famous in Nangchen. Because of his re; 
nown as well as his high level of realization, toward the end of his life he had 
become the guru to the Nangchen king. Let me tell you a bit about how this came 
about and the ramifications it would have. 

To give a bit of context, Nangchen was a country in its own right. The govern- · 
ment had twenty-five ministers of external affairs and eighteen of internal affairs, 
while the king ruled over them all. My forefathers of the Tsangsar clan fell under· 
the control of the Nangchen kings centuries ago, and this continued until an in-
vasion by Muslim warlords from Ziling in the 1930s.'' ' The invaders weren't as ' 
strong as an organized army- they were more like a gang of bandits. Still, they 
reached deep into Kham, plundering as they went; in the process both palaces 
were demolished. 

In those days Queen Yudron, whose name means Turquoise Lamp, was a Derge 
princess. She bore several children- three boys and three girls- but the children 
all died, one after the other. Many rituals were performed to remedy this recurring. 

calamity, which in Kham was regarded as a specific' 
obstacle, a demonic force called tsiu. But it was all 
to no avail. 

One of these rituals seeks to "re-summon" the, 
victim's life force and it requires a master of high' 
caliber.' .. A message was sent to the Karmapa, say-, 
ing, "Our princes and princesses have died, one af-
ter the other. Nangchen now has no male heir to · 
the throne. Please recommend a master capable of 
solving this problem." 

Nangchen t.z~•---iiiiiiiiiiiii.iiiiiiiiii.-..u 

By this time, the fifteenth Karmapa had passed 
away, and Rigpey Dorje, the sixteenth Karmapa; 



was residing at Tsurphu. He sent back this re-
p~·. "At present in the kingdom of Nangchen, 
~ere is no lama better than Samten Gyatso. 
linite him to your palace and request his pro-
tective rituals~ Simultaneously, a message-
ilso pointing to Samten Gyatso-had arrived 
from the great Situ of Palpung. So my guru was 
forced to leave his hermitage at Fortress Peak. 

An Eccentric King 

During the three years he spent at the royal palace, next to the Tsechu monas-
tery, the queen gave birth to a son, Prince Achen. In the first years of his life, the 
young prince was under Sam ten Gyatso's constant protection and, unlike his less 

fortunate siblings, didn't die. After that, the king had five more children-three 
~ns and two daughters- many of whom, I believe, are still alive. 

People believed that Samten Gyatso had used his remarkable abilities to save 
the royal lineage. Of course, the king ofNangchen was overjoyed and gave Samten 
Gyatso vast parcels of fertile land, as was the custom of kings in former times. 

So in his old age my teacher became the most important lama for the royal fam-
~-the one to whom they were extremely grateful and from whom they asked 

advice in all matters. 

Since the king ofNangchen regarded Samten Gyatso as one of his gurus, I often 

visited the palace as my uncle's attendant. Otherwise, no ordinary lama, and defi-
riitely no mere common subject, could enter the king's inner chamber-only the 
highest-ranking religious dignitaries were allowed an audience.''' 

.The king was much more interested in supporting Dharma activities than in 
secular affairs. He even refused to meet an important chieftain, calling him ·an 

:enemy of the Dharma.· 
. This king was a lama in his own right. He only slept a few hours each night and 

the rest of the time he practiced with great perseverance. He spent his entire day 
reciting the Kilaya mantra at top speed, yet clearly enunciated. He never skipped 

asyllable nor interrupted his recitation. I heard he chanted 130 million Kilaya 
.mantras during his life . 

. Eventually, the king turned over his rule to the prince and remained in strict 
meditation retreat. 

Here's another story that gives a sense of what kind ofa king he was.

Flocks of migrating wild geese and cranes would land inside the palace gardens. 
As it happened, one crane flew into his compound with a broken leg, lingering for 
a time. 

The king took this very seriously; he sent out emissaries to discover who was 
responsible for the injury. They managed to find a kid who confessed to having 
flung a stone at the bird. On hearing this, the king had the boy kept under arrest 
while the bird was treated. Only when the bird had finally recovered was the boy 
released. 

Later, there was a similar incident with a wild goose, and another teenager was 
arrested. Word then spread that all birds in the kingdom were protected by royal 
decree, so no child dared raise a stone against one. 

Samten Gyatso stayed in the old palace, while the king and his family resided in 
a new mansion nearby. In the new palace was an assembly room called the Square 
Hall, where the big chieftains, ministers and dignitaries sat in meetings, with their 
haughty airs and their fine, long-sleeved brocade chuba coats. They strutted about 
with their noses in the air, ignoring ordinary people. 

The king, who as you might have noticed was a bit eccentric, refused to al-
low any upholstered seating in the Square Hall-only hard wooden benches. No 
matter how special the ministers might think they were, they had to sit on bare 
wooden planks! 

Those officials with access to the king for secular affairs were of the elite behu 
rank. There were four of them and they all wore long garments of the finest bro-
cade. They too held their heads high, signifying their dignity and lofty status-they 
almost couldn't see the ground they were walking on. They were supposed to be 
·noblemen; but my friends and I found their self-importance amusing and en· 
joyed imitating them. 

Anyway, Sam ten Gyatso was often summoned to the palace, where he presided 
over religious ceremonies. When he arrived, he had to pass through the Square 
Hall and he would usually cough slightly before entering. When the dignitaries 
heard the cough, they would stiffen and all try to stand up at once. Once they 
tried to stand up by leaning on the shoulder of the person next to them. Then. like 
dominoes, they tumbled here and there, making a mess of themselves. 

When he finally entered the royal chambers the scene wasn't that much differ-
ent-the queen, princes and princesses immediately leapt to their feet, abandoning 
whatever they were doing. It seems everyone was afraid of him-even the king. 

Queen Yudron was fond of inviting important people to the palace. But other 



An Eccentric King 229 

than Samten Gyatso, I believe, the king allowed only the Karmapa and the great 
Situ into his private quarters. 

Once, the king invited the Karmapa into this inner sanctum to perform the 
.celebrated Black Crown ceremony with a small entourage of a shrine master, two 
trumpet players and a bursar. 

On such occasions, another great tulku might be included-but not as a mat-
ter of course. Once, it happened that Surmang Tentrul, who was one of the major 
lamas in Nangchen, had arrived at the palace along with the Karmapa. 

"WISh-Fulfilling Jewel; Tentrul requested, "please bring me in with you. The 
Nangchen king is said to be exceptional, an emanation of Avalokiteshvara. I have 
often wished to see his face at least once. But as yet he has never given me the op-
portunity. Please be so kind as to include me among your attendants;" 

"Certainly; the Karmapa replied. "You are one of my chief lamas, so why not?" 
So now there was one more in his retinue. 

After the ceremony was completed, the king turned to the Karmapa and asked 
who the extra lama was. Karmapa replied he was Surmang Tentrul. 

"Ah! So that's Surmang Tentrul. Well, well! So now we've met;" And that was 
all the king said until the Karmapa had taken leave. But then the king called the 
Karmapa's bursar back into his room. 

"Isn't Tentrul one of my subjects?" asked the king. "Isn't he a citizen ofNangchen, 
~a pebble beneath my feet? And yet he wants to be placed above me? Under the 
pretext of being one of the Karmapa's attendants, he forced his way into my private 
:quarters without asking my permission. Is this not so? 

"Now go ask that Tentrul if this is not the case-and ask him the reason for 
so.ch subterfuge. Is his plan to allow the king's subjects free passage at their own 
whim-like a stone thrown in my face? Ask him if that is his intent;" 

The bursar was usually quite bold and overbearing, but when he returned, he 
c:ouldn't bring himself to repeat the king's words to the Karmapa. So he tried to 
Skirt the issue by first conferring with Sam ten Gyatso, who in turn called my father 
Into help. 

"How do we break this news to Surmang Tentrul?• they wondered. 
One of them pointed out, "Since the king invited the Karmapa back for a dinner 

banquet, we have to tell Tentrul beforehand;" 
Another asked, "What can we say?" 
F'mally, they decided it would be best if the Karmapa himself were the one to 

explain. 
But when they beseeched the Karmapa, he replied, "I can't say anything to 

· Suimang Tentrul. He is not only one of my chosen representative lamas, he also 



230 EARLY YEARS 

holds a very high rank, having received the seal of the Chinese emperor. In ad· 
clition, he is also one of my gurus. So if anyone should apologize to the king, it. 
should be me!• 

For his part, Tentrul didn't feel he had broken any law, since he had asked per· 
mission from the Karmapa and was sincere in his wish to meet the king. The real 
problem was the king's quirky nature. The outcome of their discussions was that 
the Karmapa would sort it out himself. •If any crime has been committed, I ex· 
press my regrets; he would tell the king. 

After the Karmapa had apologized, the king replied, •There is absolutely no ·way 
I can accept an apology from the Karmapa-that is not the issue! The issue is that 
one of my subjects brazenly made his way into the king's inner chamber~ 

Such was our king's peculiar character. Whatever his reasons-either that he 
was in strict retreat much of the time or that people shouldn't be allowed free ac· 
cess to the royal palace-he wouldn't budge an inch. 

In all matters, he was very uncompromising, to say the least. 

In those days, technological innovations began to arrive in Kham from China.: 
These became known as •foreign inventions; and at one point the king issued a 
decree, •Not a single one of these foreign items will be allowed inside my palace' 
walls~ As a matter of fact, even his windows were devoid of glass, the holes being 
covered with only cloth or paper, as in olden times. He reasoned that as our for~ 
fathers did not have them, neither should we .. So while he was alive, you couldn't 
find a trace of glass anywhere in the palace. 

Next the king declared that he also didn't want foreign weaponry in his palace. 
So the soldiers had only a few single-shot muskets that, when fired, enveloped the 
marksman in a cloud of smoke. He included modern weapons within the durukA 
category, which he explained this way, ·The old prophecies mention three kinds 
of duruka: invading armies, infectious diseases, and material substances. Though 
warfare, famine, and disease are predicted to spread in our time, I will do every· 
thing possible to delay their arrival. I know that foreign goods are becoming ev~ 
more popular in my country, but I forbid a single one of these accoutrements of 
duruka to be carried through my gates~ 

The king stuck by that attitude his entire life. You might say that he was truly. 
old-fashioned. ·

My Last Days with 
Samten Gyatso 

Well before my time, Sam ten Gyatso had offered the complete transmission of the 
Nrw Treasures to the fifteenth Karmapa, Khakyab Dorje. The Karmapa's consort 
bter told me that the two lamas often sat together and talked late into the night. 
After Samten Gyatso left one evening, the Karmapa joined his palms together in 
respect and told his consort, •At this time and during this age, there is probably 

·no one who has as great and authentic a realization of the innermost essence of 
the Great Perfection as Samten Gyatso:' Such was the sincere appreciation the 
Karmapa had for my guru. 

Years later, Sam ten Gyatso invited the new incarnation, the sixteenth Karmapa, 
to the Fortress Peak hermitage, where they exchanged transmissions of spiritual 
teachings that each needed from the other. The young Karmapa held my guru in 
great esteem, since Sam ten Gyatso had taught both the Karmapa and his previous 
incarnation as well. When they were finished, the Karmapa was invited to another 
monastery and Samten Gyatso accompanied him. 

At the end of that visit, Sam ten Gyatso said to the Karmapa, •you and I will not 
meet again. I will not return to Central Tibet, and you are going west from here 
and won't be back for a long time. I'm an old man now and death is not far off. 
Today is our last meeting:' 

The Karmapa did not say a single word in reply. He only looked sad and re-
mained silent, and then Samten Gyatso departed. My father and I, who were there, 
stayed on for a few more days. This was also the last time my father saw the six-
teenth Karmapa. 

I want to tell you more about my teacher, Sam ten Gyatso, but all I can relate are 
a few fragments of his outer life story; I cannot adequately express his inner sta-
bility in meditative awareness. He was an extraordinary practitioner. He himself 



232 EARLY YEARS 

never bragged about his level of achievement and in fact very seldom gave even 
the least hint of it. Rather, he kept to the hidden path, practicing without making 
a display of his realization. Rarely, something would slip out. 

During the year preceding his death, he visited a small monastery, and I went 
along as his attendant-! may have been in my mid-twenties. •Why don't you stay 
in retreat here?• I asked. •1 will serve you:" 

•setter I go back to my hermitage; Samten Gyatso replied. ·one can't stay in 
strict retreat in a monastery:" 

That evening, I packed for our departure. We lay down to sleep but instead 
began talking. I asked him one question after another and he told story after story 
in reply. 

At one point he told me, •I received the pointing-out instruction to the unex· 
celled view of the Great Perfection at the age of eight. I recognized the nature of 
mind then and I have continued training in it steadily ever since. Because of my 
firm disposition-so typical of the 'earth element type'-I have made steady prog· 
ress. , .. My development hasn't come in leaps and bounds, but I didn't backslide 
either-just slow and steady. In fact, I only notice the change when I look back, 
comparing my present development with that of previous years. 

•you sometimes hear of yogis who advance tremendously within a few months 
and reach realization very quickly. I must admit that this never happened to me. 
Yet since I have practiced continuously from the age of eight, you might say that 
my level of practice is now fairly good. 

•I still have one problem, though: maintaining awareness in the brief period be-
tween falling asleep and actually sleeping. There are a few moments in which I still 
lose presence of mind and the awakened state is briefly lost. But once sleep begins, 
the awakened state is recognized and remains stable throughout the whole nighl 
The only challenge left now is that one small gap just as I fall asleep. 

·You are the only person I've told this to: he added. •No one else has ever asked 
me about this-and even if someone did, I wouldn't say a word;" 

At some point, I noticed that dawn had come; the birds were already singing 
outside. My first thought was that we hadn't gotten a wink of sleep. But Sarnten 
Gyatso said, •It doesn't matter, just get up! Losing a night's sleep every once ina 
while really doesn't make much of a difference;" 

This was one of the few times he shared his innermost experience. Otherwise 
he virtually never talked about his own realization. 



My Last Days with Samten Gyatso 233 

But during that winter before his passing, I talked with Samten Gyatso quite a lot, 
l!ld on occasion he revealed some extraordinary secrets about his own practice. 

One day he told me, •1 really have no great qualities, nothing marvelous to 
boast of, except that my distraction has vanished. The tendency to forget mind 
essence now seems to have vanished completely from my experience. 

'No matter how much work piles up, no matter who comes in to see me, no 
matter how inany people crowd into my room, the lucid quality only grows. 1 find 
that when I stay alone and uninvolved, with no task at hand, the clarity of aware-
ness subsides somewhat, although 1 am not distracted. But the more people, the 
more busyness and the more turmoil1 am involved in, the more the strength of 
the awareness grows. 

"Just between you and me, I am sure that I will not end up in hen.· 
Then Samten Gyatso added, ·After 1 die, there is no doubt that people will ask 

the Karmapa to find my tulku. But please understand, I honestly don't have the 
slightest ambition to have my name pinned onto someone as though he were my 
reincarnation. Maybe they will name one anyway, but as a matter of fact, I have 
already discussed this with the Karmapa. 

'I told him during his last visit to Kham, when you and I were both there with 
him, 'I am an old man who will soon die and people will come asking you to 
Mlentify my reincarnation. But truly there will be no reincarnation. My real tulku 
11ill be Tulku Urgyen and he will look after my monastery. Therefore, please don't 
recognize anybody as my reincarnation: The Karmapa didn't answer-he neither 
agreed nor disagreed:" 

I know this was my guru's wish because 1 heard it with my own ears. 
For my part I wasn't very happy to hear any of this. Back in the privacy of his 

roOm I told him, ·You are the lord of the teachings, a as and your reincarnation must 
. be found to continue this lineage. I, on the other hand, probably will roam about 
from one unknown place to another. I definitely won't remain at Lachab. I'm quite 

-unhappy to hear about what you said to the Karmapa, because I won't stay in 
Kham, absolutely not. It's one hundred percent certain that I will go somewhere 
else! I want to go where no one has heard of me:" 

"Who knows? The compassion and skil1ful means of our Wish-Fulfil1ing Jewel 
are extraordinary; Samten Gyatso responded, referring to Karmapa. ·But one thing 
~for sure: there will still not be any direct reincarnation. For that I have no wish. 
On the other hand, someone will probably come along capable of benefiting the 
Dharma and sentient beings, who will be given the title 'Samten Gyatso's tulku.-

My Guru's Passing 

In those final days I had a vague and troubling sense that my time with Samten 
Gyatso was running out. So whenever the opportunity arose I didn't waste it but 
asked for clarification on many points. 

During this time I also grew bold enough to ask about his innermost aim in life. 
Here is what he said, "In my youth, I longed for nothing but to stay in the moun-
tains, in one cave after another. I never desired the title and status of a high lama. 
In fact, I wanted to remain incognito and tried my best to do so~ 

He told me of another goal, adding, "I had a heartfelt yearning to assemble a 
complete set of Chokgyur Lingpa's termas~'86 This he managed to accomplish, col· 
lecting not only the scriptures but also the accompanying icons and mandalas, as 
well as every other necessary accoutrement-all of impeccable quality. 

Samten Gyatso always considered being a vajra master or guru for others a per-
sonal obstacle, even though he was very successful at it and became very famous. . 
Because his chief aim had actually been to spend his life practicing alone in caves, 
he lamented to me, "I have the feeling that my whole life has gone in the wrong 
direction-that I fell under the sway of obstacles~ 

In the past, the tradition was that one obeyed the command of one's guru, who 
would say, "Go to such-and-such a place and raise the victory banner of realization. 

When you have reached accomplishment, then you can truly benefit beings~ 
The disciple would go to that spot and practice one-pointedly until reaching r~ 

alization. Afterward, he or she would venture out into the world to benefit beings. 
That is the way it should be. Without receiving permission or the command from 
one's guru, one does not start to work for the welfare of others as a vajra mastet 
But after receiving the command or permission, one should definitely undertake 
the task. 

When Sam ten Gyatso grew older, he often thought, "I should have stayed in 
caves, but instead I fell under the power of hindrances:' 



My Gums Passing 235 

This wasn't just talk: he actually felt that way. He had no ambition to become a 
njra master or sit above anyone else. He once explained, ·Being successful is actu-
ally called the pleasant obstacle .. Whereas any unpleasant obstacle is easily recog-
wd by all, success is rarely acknowledged to be a barrier on the path. Unpleasant 
obstacles include, for example, being defamed or implicated in scandal, falling 
sick or otherwise meeting with failure and misfortune. Able practitioners can deal 
with these. They recognize these situations as obstacles and use them as part of 
the path. 

"But with pleasant obstacles-such as becoming renowned, having disciples 
gather around you and working for the welfare of others-one starts to think, 
'Well. now! I'm becoming really special. I'm benefiting many beings. Everything is 
fine! I'm so successful' -without recognizing that the infatuation with success is a 
major hindrance to progress.'" 

When this happens, Samten Gyatso warned that people only think, •My altru-
~c capacity to benefit others is expanding!• This is what they tell themselves, all 
the while failing to notice that they have actually fallen prey to an obstacle. 

Samten Gyatso once mentioned, with his usual understatement, that he ex-
pected his family would render at least a small service to the continuity of the New 
Treasures. 

My cousin Khentrul, who was the reincarnation of Karmey Khenpo, was ex-
c:redingly sharp-minded and well-versed in the Buddhist scriptures. 1 took it for 
granted that he would be the main lineage holder. But that was not in Samten 
Gyatso's plans. Khentrul and I often lived in the same gompa, and yet I was closer 
ID Samten Gyatso. I often wondered why our master never treated Khentrul as a 
lineage holder, •If not him, then who could possibly hold the lineage? Why doesn't 
Samten Gyatso give him more special treatment?• 

This young man was already quite learned as well as very gutsy, with a com-
manding presence. But at some point he went to Central Tibet to receive more 
l!achings and empowerments, and we got the news that he had passed away 
there. 

We were all very sad when Khentrul passed away-and before he was able to 
transmit the lineage. Otherwise I have no doubt he would have been a competent 
master. But looking back, I think Samten Gyatso most likely had realized that 
Khentrul's life force wouldn't hold and that he would die young. 

After Khentrul's passing, Samten Gyatso said, •you are my second hope for the 
rontinuation of this lineage.'" It was very unusual for him to talk like this. He would 



236 EARLY YEARS 

never flatter anyone, least of all members of his own family; he wouldn't even 
compliment the Karmapa to his face. 

On the other hand he never criticized anyone. If anyone was at fault, he would 
simply overlook it, saying nothing. I heard him praise only Khyentse, Kongtrul and 
Chokling-no one else. He was very dignified and reserved, a no-nonsense kindci 
guy. Unless you knew him very well, you would have absolutely no clue as to Yt'hat 
his opinion really was. 

But I looked at myself frankly and thought, ·rm nothing special. I'm not well 
educated. My only advantage is that I've lived with Samten Gyatso~ In those days, 
I had no particular ambition except just to stay by his side. 

He told me several times, ·Whether the lineage of the New Treasures will be 
broken one day is in your hands. So I hope my being a little firm with you will pay 
ofi. 

When Adeu Rinpoche came from Nangchen some years back, he said that bad 
home they regard me as the main holder of the New Treasures. This isn't because 
I have been especially diligent; it is entirely due to Sam ten Gyatso. 

Since we shared the same monastery and I stayed with Sam ten Gyatso all Ill 
time, asking to be excused when he gave an empowerment was simply out oftm 
question. 

•I am expecting that you will uphold this lineage later on: he would say. In 
this way, I received every single empowerment and teaching he gave. This was 
not always by my own choice-I just didn't dare be absent since he could be very 
intimidating. 

Near the end of his life, Samten Gyatso gave me a special entrustment to the 
guardians of the New Treasures,'17 a transmission he had never given to anyone 
else. Chokgyur Lingpa had given this particular practice to the great Kongtrul 
only, who had then given it only to Karmey Khenpo, from whom Samten Gyatso 
received it. He was now the only person who knew the particulars and practiced~ 
regularly at Fortress Peak. One of its special functions was to protect crops agairut 
fr~ -

Unfortunately, one of my personality traits seems to be a lack of perseverance. 
If a transmission required any kind of serious attention on a daily basis, it went 
against my nature. That's why I didn't pursue the special applications of that p!iiC· 
tice.'11 So today I have the reading transmission and empowerment and can pass 
them on, but not the know-how necessary for practical application. Apparently no 
one else does either. 



My Guru's Passing 237 

In Gangtok, Dzongsar Khyentse asked if I had brought some of the charmed 
~ce produced during that practice, and I gave him whatever I had. Now I 
bl·e none left and, even though Dzongsar Khyentse attested to its immense ef-
ictiveness, there is no one left who can make it. 

Before my father and uncles each passed away, their faces seemed to change in 
uemarkable way, as if they were becoming younger. Their gray hairs did not turn 
Nack, but their skin definitely became younger-looking and shiny. Some say that 
~youthful skin tone and radiance is a sign of realization. And, in fact, the tantric 
,mptures mention that at a certain level of experience and realization, the skin 
.~mes soft and supple. 

I first noticed the change with Sam ten Gyatso. The year he left his body, his skin 
became noticeably vibrant. His facial features seemed like those of a young man, 
mthatyou totally forgot that he was indeed quite old. His skin had become a light, 
bstrous color, as if something unusual were happening from inside. 

Before that he had looked old and tired, but then he suddenly took on this 
JOOthful appearance. People would ask, "How old are you really, Samten Gyatso? 
You look so young! What happened? Are they feeding you something magical or 
ire you doing some special practice?" 

This shift in appearance began about a year before he died. But honestly, if you 
!bought about it, it wasn't a good sign-somewhere in the back of your mind, you 
~t that it couldn't last. 

It was the same with my father. His skin glowed with a bronze hue; you could 
:.aJ!ita majestic brilliance, as though there were embers behind the skin. His face 
wo took on a very fresh, youthful appearance. He died three months later. 

When Uncle Sang-Ngak passed away, I was at Tsurphu, but I heard that the 
·Aille thing happened with him. All the local people noticed that his wrinkles had 
'disappeared and wondered why. They said among themselves, "What has hap-
pened to Sang-Ngak Rinpoche to make him look so young? We can't see his wrin-
llesanymore. We've seen this twice before with his older brothers-could this be 
a sign that he may die this year?" And such was indeed the case, for he died later 
tliatyear. 

Uncle Tersey once remarked to me, "Ordinarily one ought to be happy when 
· &Jse family members like my brothers seem so young and radiant at their age. 
Pmlam not. I feel it's a bad sign; it means that death is near~ As for Uncle Tersey 
~.not long before he passed on, although his hair was gray, his face was like 

·!bat of a young man. 



238 EARLY YEARS 

That was how one could foresee that these brothers would soon die. I'm not 
making this up, nor is it just one or two people's impression-every single person 
who met them remarked on it. 

Near the end of his life, Samten Gyatso entered retreat, intending to remain 
there for the rest of his life. But instead of announcing this directly, he simp~ 
made it known that he was going to stay in loose retreat for two weeks at Fortr~ 
Peak, a day's journey away from Lachab. During that time he would perform pro-
tective rituals for the people of the country. Then, once he settled in, he sent the 
message that now was the time for him to stay in strict retreat for a while. 

But after only a short time had passed, the prince of Nangchen fell ill and two 
important ministers were sent to summon Samten Gyatso. 

"Our prince is gravely ill and may soon pass away~ they announced. "You must 
come back with us to the palace. We've been directed by His Majesty not to return 
without you, so we're not going to!" 

As these two dignitaries waited in the guest room, those of us close to Samten 
Gyatso debated what to do. Uncle Sang-Ngak was around at that time, as weD as his 
sister Tashi Chimey, who served as the steward of his monastery and retreat centet 

Even though I was only a youngster, I wasn't intimidated by the ruling family. I 
argued that Sam ten Gyatso should not leave retreat at anyone's request, no matter 
how important they were. 

Someone else made the counter-argument, "Earlier, the master stayed at the 
royal palace for three years and often performed ceremonies to support the king. 
Everything has been auspicious so far. The king donated a huge piece of land .,.,;th 
many fertile fields to our monastery. He has been a very generous benefactor. So' 
there is really no choice-Samten Gyatso must break retreat and go there~ 

"Our teacher should ignore the message and refuse to go,· I insisted with ai 
sincerity, though perhaps a bit naively. 

Someone again countered, "Our king has given a command-don't subjects 
usually obey?" 

"Even though it's difficult to refuse such a command~ I continued, "if you agr~ 
this time, you will always have to acquiesce. Since our guru is so highly treasured. 
I'm afraid that everyone may ask him to do one thing after another. The requests 
will be endless!" 

A sense of foreboding weighed heavily on my mind. One of my less adrnirab~ 
traits is that I can't keep such feelings to myself. Therefore, with my whole heart, I 
tried to dissuade everyone in the room. 



A1y Guru's Passing 239 

At one point during the discussion, the decision was actually made not to go. 
te informed the two waiting ministers of this. 
· But one of them replied, •If that is the case, we will not return to the royal 
~ce. We'll just spend the rest of our days here! I'll sleep right there in front of 
i..11ten Gyatso's door!• 

He said this in the adamant manner so typical of the hardheaded and tenacious 
.lllampas. He added, •Even if I have to wait for Samten Gyatso at Fortress Peak for 
-~eyears,I am not returning without him!• 

M that point another important lama said, "If Samten Gyatso refuses and the 
JO'.IIlS prince dies what will happen? Really, he has no choice but to go:' 

Eventually, a consensus emerged that Samten Gyatso had to go. I gave it one 
hoi try, raising my voice to say, ·u he breaks retreat now to go to the royal palace, 
thtre will be no end-he will never be able to get back into retreat. If you obey the 
ling's wish this time, you cannot disobey in the future-you will always have to 
oomply. Therefore ask to be excused and stay firm:' 

But it seemed I was the only one in the entire group who held this opinion and, 
lll was still regarded as a youngster, how much power did I have to persuade any-
me? The others had the final say and in the end Sam ten Gyatso decided to go . 
. I was asked to go along but refused, "1 definitely won't go, especially not under 

~.ese circumstances. To tell you the truth, I am deeply unhappy about this turn of 
t;ents. Please excuse me; I am going back to Lachab:' 

Just before Sam ten Gyatso left, his small knife was nowhere to be found. He had 
cever parted with this knife; the sheath was still there, but the knife was missing 
and he had to leave without it. 

On arriving at the royal palace, Samten Gyatso began an elaborate nine-day 
-ll~gevity ritual.'" By the time the ceremony concluded, young prince Achen had 
'recovered. No trace of disease or any evil influence remained-such was the pow-
·erful effect of that ritual. 

:Then, just as I feared, there was another request. Since the queen of Nangchen 
~nged to the royal family of Derge, Sam ten Gyatso was invited to perform cer-
emonies at the Derge court as well. A long procession was formed to welcome him 

. ~re and they treated him with the deep respect that all who are hosted by the 
royal court receive. Finally, after several weeks, he completed his responsibilities 
md set off back home. 

E\-erything seemed to have gone well until he reached the foothill below Fortress 
Peak. where he fell off his horse and injured his leg. His attendants helped him 



240 EARLY YEARS 

back up on the horse for what would be his last ride up to the hermitage. I'm not 
sure what went wrong, but he wasn't able to walk after that. 

The morning after Sam ten Gyatso arrived, he sent for me at Lachab. It took the 
messenger a full day to reach our monastery. It was late afternoon by the time a 
monk walked in. "Samgya Rinpoche has fallen ill," he said, referring to my guru. "It 
appears to be quite serious and he is asking for you;" 

Hearing this filled me with overwhelming sadness and I was overcome by the 
gripping intuition that Sam ten Gyatso was about to leave us. It certainly was in· 
auspicious for him to leave retreat-and the missing knife couldn't have been a 
good omen either. I hadn't had a moment of joy since he left; in fact that very 
morning I'd had a deeply ominous dream in which I saw that Sam ten Gyatso was 
about to leave Fortress Peak. I was there as his attendant. Looking up toward the 
western mountains, I saw that the sun was low in the sky. 

"Hey, Rinpoche!" I urged, "Don't leave now! The sun is about to set behind the 
mountains! Don't travel in the dark; please turn around and come back in." 

I reached for him with my hand to guide him back in, but he said in response. 
"No, no! My time has come; I have no choice but to leave;" 

In the dream I pleaded, "Please don't say that!" 
But he replied, "Isn't it true that the power of karma is unstoppable?" He slipped 

from my grasp and rode off. A moment later, the sun set and he vanished into the 
darkness. 

The next moment, I woke up and thought, "What an awful dream!" That morn-
ing, I told my cook, "I had a disturbing dream about Sam ten Gyatso. It makes me 
think he has arrived back at Fortress Peak;" 

"Don't say such things!" the old cook protested. 
So when the messenger arrived later that day to summon me to Fortress Peak, it 

came as no surprise-the only thought in my mind had been that our guru was close 
to death, a thought as painful as a knife in the heart. It was very hard to sleep that 
night and long before daybreak I was up preparing for the ride to Fortress Peak. 

After more than twelve hours on the trail, still out of breath, I walked directly 
into Sam ten Gyatso's room and asked him about his health. Clearly he was in bad 
shape, suffering from relentless pain. He wasn't able to speak more than a few 
words. 

Two doctors were consulted, but, to be frank, they were completely useless. 
One of them diagnosed the dreaded illness known as "thirtyfold blackness· and 
saw signs that Samten Gyatso's intestines had ruptured. 



Afy Guru's Passing 241 

'He needs to be treated with fire; the other said, "but that should have been 
oone long ago. It's too late now and I'm not sure I can do it.'" 

The doctor was speaking of mctsa, a traditional medical treatment reserved for 
~tr.ous illnesses.'"' I prepared the tool for the fire treatment, then lightly touched 
his skin with the red-hot iron. This alleviated the pain somewhat and he was able 
to say a few words. But what good was temporary relief when the disease was eat-
ing away at hls bowels? 

'Rinpoche, it doesn't look good!" I said. "What is going to happen?" 
'Who knows?" he replied. "Chokgyur Lingpa and most of his descendants 

didn't live long. His son Wangchok Dorje died young. His daughter, our precious 
.~other, did better, living to well over seventy. His other son Tsewang Norbu died 
in his sixties. On the other side of the family, our Tsangsar lineage also doesn't 
iem to be long-lived. Nearly everyone in this lineage, including my own father, 
hlsdied in their fifties. I am now sixty-five. 

'On the other hand," he continued, "It's fine for me to die now. It really makes 
DO difference. It's fine if I live a little longer, but if I pass on it's also fine. I've had 
enough time.'" 
. 'Rinpoche; I then asked, "is there anything I can do to help you recover?" 
'Don't talk about this any longer; he replied. 
'This made me extremely sad. Later that day my last hopes for his recovery 

faded. Oearly he was on the verge of leaving his body. 

At one point, my guru said, "Manifestations of mind defy the reach of words. 
'11\ere is no point in attempting to express them for the descriptions would be 
enP!ess. I see this now. There is nothing left unseen, nothing left unheard. All phe-
oomena of samsara and nirvana can manifest from this mind-don't you agree?" 

"Yes, Rinpoche," I replied. 
The situation seemed to demand that I play along, even though this profound 

perspective surely wasn't part of my immediate experience. I had never had any 
doubt as to Samten Gyatso's extremely high level of realization and clairvoyance, 
but it was becoming even more apparent as he reached the end of this incarnation. 
He seemed to speak from a state of unimpeded mind. 

After a period of silence, he continued, "Ah! Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo has 
,l:ome! Now the great terton Chokgyur Lingpa has arrived! And here comes Jamgon 
~ngtrul!" 

Among all the masters, it was in Kongtrul that he had the greatest trust, an 
incredible faith. He marveled at Kongtrul's writings and often described him in 



242 EARLY YEARS 

these terms, ·The incarnation of the translator Vairotsana, Buddha Vairochana 
in human form, who was proclaimed with the glorious conch-the unambiguous 
and fearless voice of Shakyamuni-with the name Infinite Wisdom:'''' This was a 
reference to Kongtrul having been prophesied by the Buddha. 

And now Samten Gyatso said that he too had arrived. It made me even sadder 
to hear this, because now I felt that there wasn't much time left. 

His attendant Dudul and I didn't sleep that night but stayed up to take care of 
him. We tried to give him something to eat, but he was only able to drink a little 
water and was so weak he couldn't say more than a word or two. Dudul was fond 
of sleeping and soon I found myself alone with my ailing guru. Throughout the 
night, the only words Samten Gyatso uttered were to request a drink of water. 

We all started to feel the end was close. I asked him but he would neither 
confirm nor deny his departure. All he said was, •1 can't say. Let's wait and see 
Tomorrow morning it will be clear. Either way, there's no need to worry:' 

The next morning his fever began to rise even higher. 

Right around this time, my brother Penjik was involved in a land dispute. He 
had a very assertive, even confrontational personality. Later we found out that on 
this very day-the nineteenth day of the fourth month-a gang of rivals had caught 
up with him. At that moment, Samten Gyatso exclaimed from his bed, ·oh no!" 

·What is it, Rinpocher I asked. 
Once more he said, ·oh no!· adding. ·Penjik is in big trouble!· 
·What's wrong with him, Rinpoche?· I asked 
Samten Gyatso replied, ·oh no! Now Penjik's in dire peril! He's about to be 

stabbed!• 
From time to time, Khampas in our region would have gang fights, and occa-

sionally one or two would enter the bardo rather than returning home. As a matter 
of fact, a few months earlier, Penjik's attendant had been among the unfortunate 
ones killed in a fight. 

Referring to him now, Samten Gyatso continued, ·Penjik's late attendant now 
tells me that he owned a horse. After his death, when his possessions were given 
away in his name to increase his merit, his family for some reason forgot to in· 
elude that horse. Now he asks me to please tell his family to sell the horse and 
make offerings. He is in the bardo and needs help:' 

After a while Samten Gyatso added, ·well, well, there's no end to what one 
could say-so what's the use of talking endlessly:' Then he smiled, chuckling as he 
looked at me. · 



My Guru's Passing 243 

I spent that entire night in his room. Early in the morning, I asked how he 
fe!t Instead of answering me directly, he addressed me affectionately and asked, 
'Kargah, has morning broken yet?"'9" 

"Yes, it's about dawn." 
"WeU then, ask Ngakdi Lama to come in: Samten Gyatso whispered, using 

Uncle Sang-Ngak's nickname. I told Dudul to fetch him. 
Uncle Sang-Ngak arrived and bowed down three times. 
Samten Gyatso invited him to sit on a small throne. Then he said, "Well, well! 

Since the lama is here, why don't we all chant Jamgon Kongtrul's Calling the Guru 
from Afar?" 

This is a very famous text intended to open one's heart with devotion, a state in 
which it is much easier to merge our minds with the guru's. 

We began to chant together, Uncle Sang-Ngak leading with the lines: 

Lama, hear me. 
Kind root lama, hear me. 
Essence of the buddhas of the three times, 
Source of the sublime Dharma, realization and the statements, 
Sovereign of Sangha, assembly of noble ones, 
Root lama, hear me. 

As we chanted, Sam ten Gyatso sang along with us in a surprisingly strong voice. 
He was now sitting up with his legs loosely crossed, the palms of his hands cover-
ing his knees in the meditation posture known as "resting in the nature of mind." 
He wore a cloth cap with earflaps to protect his bald head from the cold and there 
was a remarkable glow to his skin. 

We never reached the end of that prayer, because at some point Sam ten Gyatso 
interrupted by repeating this one sentence from the text: 

Bless me to sincerely be aware of death. 

We all stopped chanting and a few moments later he sang the line again: 

Bless me to sincerely be aware of death. 

As the sun began to rise, he sang it a third time and then his body sagged 
slightly. You could see the looseness that comes over the body at the moment 
of death. 

As llooked at my guru, I was convinced that he had passed away, even though 
his face had a beautiful smile, and his eyes were clear and wide open, looking very 

:much alive. His skin was glowing, almost luminous. 



244 EARLY YEARS 

He was still sitting in the same meditation posture seen in depictions of the 
renowned master Longchenpa. He looked perfectly confident and composed but 
showed no signs of either pulse or breath. 

According to Dzogchen tradition, at a particular moment in the death process, 
one can remind a practitioner of the ultimate nature of mind by repeating the syl-
lable AH twenty~one times into his ear. I now knelt close to him and began repeat-
ing, •AH, AH, AH, AH, AH ••• • 

But I ran out of breath and felt I had to start over again. As I was drawing my 
breath for a second time, he nodded his head quite clearly, as if to indicate that he 
had already gotten the point. 

I still recited the sequence a second time and he nodded again, but only slightly. 
Since I wasn't sure that this was enough, I continued with a third repetition. As 

I ended, his body drew even more upright. He sat there with brilliant, wide~pen 
eyes and a lucid smile. 

It truly seemed as if he hadn't died at all.'" 
Only Dudul, Uncle Sang-Ngak, and I were present. If Uncle Tersey had been 

there, no doubt he would have had the audacity to request precise information 
as to where Samten Gyatso's reincarnation could be found He was able to ask 
such highly personal questions. I hadn't dared to ask, remembering what Samten 
Gyatso had said to the Karmapa earlier about not wanting a tulku to be found after 
he died. And, anyway, I was overcome with sadness. 

Our guru had departed from this world and there was simply nothing we could 
do about it. 

After a while, we wrapped his body in brocade. Later that afternoon, it was car-
ried down and placed on a throne in the main shrine hall. A great master's body 
is usually placed inside a huge copper tray to prevent liquid from seeping out and 
covered with bags of salt to absorb the moisture; robes are then wrapped over aU 
this. 

On the table in front of him we placed his vajra and bell, as well as other ritual 
implements. When people looked at his face they simply refused to believe that he 
had passed away. He still looked alive, smiling peact>fully with brilliant clear e)·es, 
and he remained like that for three days. Then the body started to sag a little and 
we covered his face. 

A messenger had been sent off to Uncle Tersey, who was residing at Riwoche 
monastery, and another to inform my father. My father arrived on the third day. 
but Riwoche was a five-day journey each way, so Uncle Tersey didn't reach Fortress 



My Gum's Passing 245 

Peak until the following week. Once everyone had gathered, we began a drubchen 
in the presence of the kudung-the sacred remains. 

A monk from Lachab, who was later killed during the Chinese invasion, was 
.o\'erheard exclaiming, ·How can someone like Samten Gyatso die? I don't believe 
it. It's simply not possible! It never crossed my mind that he could die. But if it is 
true, then there's absolutely nothing to rely on in this world.'" 

I asked him, ·why would you think that?• 
·secause he was perfectly reliable in every way; he replied. ·Because of his 

firmness and sense of precision. He had unchanging integrity-not a speck of de-
ceit. How could someone like that die?• 

After the cremation, we discovered something remarkable among the ashes: 
the skull was still intact.'" And one of his garments was undamaged by the fire, 
though all the rest burned up; for some reason this doth had all the five colors of 
the rainbow on it. His ashes contained numerous relics, both those known as dung 
andringsel 

During the cremation, everyone present witnessed an incredible display of 
rainbow patterns in the sky. It was amazing, since the sky was a deep blue, so dear 
you couldn't see a single cloud anywhere. As you may know, this is considered the 
best sign. 

Such were the signs that accompanied my guru's passing into the unmanifest 
space of all phenomena. With my ordinary eyes, this is what I was able to witness; 
beyond this there is not much more I can say concerning his general life story. 

All three of Samten Gyatso's brothers had gathered for his cremation. In 
Kham it was customary to perform two rituals after someone's death; one was 
Cho and the other dur. The dur pertains to certain classes of spirits connected 
to each and every person's corporeal existence. In the main part of the ritual, the 
presiding master disengages nine devouring spirits from the vital energy of the 
deceased. The understanding is that unless these nine spirits are disconnected 
when a person dies, they can slow down or create obstacles to liberation in the 
bardo. 

My father, of course, performed the Cho. Though superstition held that the dur 
~ouldn't be performed by the son or father or other dose male relative, I volun-
teered to carry out the ritual and nothing untoward happened. 

Often I have heard of families in Nepal complaining that the ghost of the de-
ceased relative has returned home to haunt the premises-sometimes even stories 
of a husband trying to get back into bed with his wife after he's dead and cremated. 



246 EARLY YEARS 

The wife doesn't see anything but might, for example, hear his voice or the sound 
of snoring. In Kham though I never heard of this happening-perhaps because 
there we always pacified these nine spirits by means of Cho and dur as soon as 
someone died. 

The dur rituals have both a peaceful and a subjugating aspect. Sometimes they 
involve ritual name·burning, a pacifying activity that summons the deceased's 
consciousness, purifies it, and sends it to a buddhafield. The subjugating aspect 
exorcises evil influences that may have taken possession of the deceased. These 
devouring spirits are demon ghosts, a type of sentient being. You hear a lot of 
HUNG and PHAT during the part of the ritual where the nine spirits are being 
chased from their various hiding places. 

This ceremony is necessary even for a great being like Samten Gyatso because 
such a master's splendor attracts many mundane spirits. The same holds true 
for most great vajra holders, because there is a certain interrelationship between 
these nine spiri.ts and the master dissolving into the invisible sphere that is the 
basic space of all things. 

Because Chimey Dorje was such a powerful master and an adept ChO practitio-
ner, he probably succeeded in •divorcing• these nine spirits. 

When all these rituals were completed, I made the journey to Central1ibet 
to make the customary offerings in connection with Samten Gyatso's passing. In 
Lhasa I ran into one of Samten Gyatso's disciples from Derge, who was a very 
devoted but headstrong lama. Even though he had heard about Samten Gyatso's 
explicit wish that the Karmapa not be asked to find a tulku, this lama joined forces 
with the bursar of our monastery and went off to Central Tibet to ask the Karmapa 
anyway. 

We exchanged a few words. ·oidn't your guru tell you not to look for his tulkur 
I asked him. ·And yet against his will you travel all the way to see the Karmapa~ 

But that did no good as Khampas can be quite obstinate, as it is said: ·Khampas 
are headstrong like yaks-either bandits or great meditators:" 

So the disciple went ahead and asked the Karmapa despite all my objections. 
That's why today someone is known as Sam ten Gyatso's tulku.

Meetings with a 
Remar/(able Teacher 

.While in Central Tibet I had the opportunity to meet the Karmapa once again. 
I went to Tsurphu and stayed for two weeks. Then, after a few days in Lhasa, I 
headed straight back to Kham. 

After arriving in Nangchen I assumed responsibility for Lachab Gompa. In 
spite of that obligation I tried to cut all involvements and go into a strict retreat 
for three years. My father looked after the monastery and during my seclusion he 
passed away. The time in retreat added up to three years though it was interrupted 
by the instability of the time. •9s 

During this period, I invited Kyungtrul Kargyam, a precious master whom I 
regard as one of my more important teachers and root gurus. Kyungtrul had big, 
bloodshot eyes and dark skin. He was also extremely gentle and kind. He was 
amazing and I feel grateful to have known such an accomplished master-anyone 
~no met him would be impressed. 

He had come by his education as if it were second nature and was extremely 
learned, especially in the philosophical scriptures. I felt that there was no question 
!could ask about practice for which he would lack a profound reply. No one knows 
how he became so learned so quickly, but at the age of thirteen he had already 
gi\'en the reading transmission and an explanation of the entire Kangyur to a large 
gathering. Everyone was amazed at how this kid could explain the Buddha's words 
so clearly. 
·.• Even then it was expected he would turn out to be an outstanding master and 
the overseers of his monastery treated him specially-that is, until, under the cov-
er of night, he fled to Derge, where he stayed with Barwey Dorje, a master who 
had been a disciple of the great terton.'" He was just sixteen at the time. 

Barwey Dorje received him warmly, giving him guidance as well as the point-
ing-out instruction. ·You are truly a sublime being; the master told his young 
student. ·Just travel around Derge-you don't need to go anywhere else:' 



248 EARLY YEARS 

Then Barwey Dorje gave him a list of the most important masters to visit 
Kyungtrul made the journey on foot, dressed as a beggar and carrying only a staff 
and a knapsack. He first went to Palpung where he met the great scholar Tashi 
Ozer and received many teachings. Tashi Ozer asked him where he came from 
and he replied that he came from the Kyungpo region. When he left, Tashi Ow 
said, ·He must be a tulku, let's call him Kyungtrul-the tulku from Kyungpo; and 
the name stuck. 

Later, Kyungtrul went on to the four main Nyingma monasteries in Kham-
Shechen, Dzogchen, Katok, and Palyul-and managed to meet every single great 
master, including the famed Khenpo Ngakchung. On the way back, he again vis-
ited Palpung, where the great Situ was so impressed that he made Kyungtrul the 
master at the retreat center for nine years. 

During this time, Kyungtrul had many visions and extraordinary dreams, as 
well as signs indicating he was a terton. Though he was effortlessly able to write 
down one practice after the other, he held these termas back and refused to put 
them in writing until he had received the Karmapa's stamp of approval. Finally, 
he asked Situ for permission to leave and return to his homeland, Nangchen. He 
didn't rest there, though, as he felt a strong need to meet the Karmapa. 

Years later, Kyungtrul told me, ·The Karmapa was the one who could decide 
whether my mind treasures were authentic. Only he can verify a terton and whether 
the termas will turn out to be beneficial. I could have written down so much more-, 
there is no end to what can surge forth from the expanse of the all-ground.· 

The only terma Kyungtrul had written down at the time was a sadhana for 
the Three Roots, which was astoundingly beautiful. But before he could reach 
Tsurphu, the great Karmapa left his body-and therefore he never received the 
authorization.'97 

At Tsurphu, Kyungtrul met Samten Gyatso, who was saddened that, for some 
karmic reason, he had been unable to offer the Karmapa the transmission of the 
Three Sections of the Great Perfection-Mind, Space and Instruction. And now 
Jam pal Tsultrim, one of the Karmapa's chief disciples, repeatedly requested these 
very empowerments. 

Kyungtrul too wanted to receive this transmission, so Sam ten Gyatso told him. 
·well, if you are also participating in the transmission of the Three Sections, you 
must use your skill and erudition to compose an empowerment manual.· Kyungtrul 
consented to help and succeeded in arranging the empowerments for the Mind 
Section. '91 



Meetings with a Remarkable Teacher 249 

Samten Gyatso gave the empowerments at Lotus Garuda Fortress, the famous 
retreat center above Tsurphu. As he did so, Kyungtrul wrote the liturgical arrange-
ment and during this process they were able to discuss many fine points. Due to 
K)ungtrul's broad knowledge, the manual for the first section filled an entire vol-
.mne by itself. Sometimes when the scope of a master's learning is extremely vast, 
be can write endlessly. 

Shortly after the empowerments began the young Dudjom arrived, unencum-
bered by servants, a following or possessions. Being from the Pemako province he 
was becoming famous under the name Peko Dudjom. He was a ngakpa with long 
hair and a white skirt. He too requested some of the empowermcnts and joined 
the others. The young Dudjom put up a small tent in a meadow and stayed there 
for nineteen days. '99 

Dudjom also offered to help Kyungtrul with the empowerment manual by writ-
ing notes for the sequence. Dudjom wrote in an abbreviated style and had caught 
op by the end of each empowerment. Kyungtrul was then asked how long it would 
take him to finish the manual. 

"If I make it short, it will take four months; otherwise it looks like it will 
take me about one year,• he replied. Hearing this, Dudjom expressed surprise. 
But Kyungtrul made the empowerment manual so detailed and elaborate that it 
didn't get finished. In the end, as time passed, their combined effort was never 
completed. Kyungtrul said he didn't feel like staying around until the writing 
was done, so he left, bringing the copy of his empowerment text back to Fortress 
Peak.-

With this story in mind, when I later met with Kyungtrul, I asked him if he 
would please lend me what he had written so that I could read it. It was a small and 
beautifully composed volume, but I am sorry to say that he seemed to have gotten 
carried away by elaborate details-he was so extremely learned and had added in 
an the lines of transmission to the Mind Section. It was also amazingly profound, 
but if they had continued like this, the Mind Section alone would have been a large 
volume unto itself. 

Kyungtrul admitted that Samten Gyatso had told him, •It's wonderful that you 
can write like this, but if I have to give the empowerment with such precise de-
tail. it will take a year each time. I don't have time to stay at Tsurphu for a whole · 
year!·101 

Reading this text deepened my faith in Kyungtrul. His opening lecture in 
the empowerment manual was so elaborate and brilliant it surpassed anything 
I had ever read. It wasn't that Samten Gyatso was displeased at this-on the 
contrary. 



250 EARLY YEARS 

At this point, Kyungtrul himself had said, •I very much doubt that my efforts in 
this will come to anything.:" And he was right-he never wrote the manuals for the 
Space and Instruction Sections. 

Back in Kham, Kyungtrul became known as a terton and, being from a long 
line of ngakpas, took a consort. He was also requested to give teachings and em· 
powerments more and more frequently. He transmitted the entire Treasury of 
Precious Term as twice.,_ While receiving the One Hundred Cho empowerments 
from Kyungtrul, my father became good friends with him. Samten Gyatso also 
treated him with deep respect. 

As noted earlier, I invited Kyungtrul to Tsangsar monastery to give the trans· 
missions for the Great Perfection entitled Realization Directly Revealed-teach-
ings for which he showed the deepest respect-and to Lachab for the CoUected 
Nyingma Tantras in a special annotated edition.101 

In this way, he spent three months with us, and we often relaxed together and 
had interesting conversations. Occasionally he would say, •1 must leave; I want to 
go to Pemako.:" 

But I asked him to delay his departure for the sake of the Buddha's teachings 
and sentient beings, and each time he replied, •All right, that's fine by me. In the 
end, it doesn't make any difference.:" 

Then he would stay a while longer. One day, he suddenly left his body. 
When I look back on those times and what followed in the next few years right 

after his passing, it appears that he had a clear foreknowledge of what would befall 
Tibet and Kham, though he didn't mention anything in detail. 

I was fortunate enough to receive three months of instructions on the Light of 
\VlSdom from KyungtruL He was staying in a cave that was connected to a small 
shrine room. In the mornings he would sit outside in the sun and enjoy one of his 
favorite meals: pea soup. He would lick his bowl at the end and set it aside, looking 
fresh and content 

One morning, I mustered the courage to say, •please teach me the Treasury of 
Dharmadhatu. • 

·well, well; he replied. ·oo you want me to read it to you?" 
·Not just read it, I want you to explain it.:" 
·well, well, these days it appears that nothing is impossible; he answered, then 

made a joke about an ordinary lama who was teaching a laywoman the profound 



Meetings with a Remarkable Teacher 251 

realization of Longchenpa, speaking as if the lama was a serene vajra master pour-
ing forth the nectarlike Dharma for a qualified dakini at the Mansion of Lotus 
light-until he burst out laughing.-

You see, the woman in question was actually my aunt, who had recently re-
quested the same teaching from a disciple of Dzongsar Khyentse at Fortress Peak, 
~itich for some reason Kyungtrul found incredibly funny. He played on the word 
.for samsara, which means "realm of possibilities; by saying, "This only goes to 
show that nothing is impossible:' 

All of which was simply Kyungtrul's way of making the point that teaching the 
profound Treasury ofDharmadhatu is no simple task. I asked again the next morn-
ing to which he replied with the same story and once again burst out laughing. 

While Kyungtrul was staying with us, people would often come to him for in-
structions on knowing the nature of mind. One young meditator came and, as is 
traditional, related his experience. 

At some point Kyungtrul said, "It seems to me that you should simply allow 
basic space and awareness to be intermingled:' 

"Very well, Rinpoche; the young man replied. "But how large should the space 
ber 

Kyungtrul kept a straight face as he replied, "Oh yes, oh yes! Mingle it with any 
size that makes you comfortable; that would be fine:'aos 

The young fellow was persistent, however, since he continued, "Please, Rinpoche, 
give me the true meditation instruction on mind essence!" 

"Oh yes, oh yes; he replied, still keeping a straight face. "It appears that I myself 
haven't received the true instruction:' 

One could, however, see the mirth sparkle in his eyes. 

Several years before, on his way home from the New Treasures empowerments 
at Surman g. Dzigar Kongtrul stopped at Neten monastery while Kyungtrul was 
giving the Treasury of Precious Termas. They had became very close friends. Later 
I had the opportunity to ask Dzigar Kongtrul questions and our conversation of-
ten gravitated to the life of great masters. At times we just relaxed, talking until 
we heard the birds begin to sing in the early morning and realized we had totally 
forgotten to sleep. 

One of the things Dzigar Kongtrul confided to me was that "nowadays, in all of 
Tibet and Kham, Kyungtrul is probably the greatest master. I have studied many of 



252 EARLY YEARS 

the scriptures with many a good master, but when Kyungtrul and I discussed any 
topic, be it philosophy or any of the sciences, I knew some points better than he 
did, except for one thing: he seemed to know the details of the lives of every sin~e 
master in this Land of Snow. 

·sut, strangely enough, when we met two years later, although I had the feel· 
ing that by then I knew as much as he, once again he knew many more precise 
details of their lives. Then again a year later he seemed to know even more than 
before.* 

•I have no idea where he learned all of these details. If they were just from the 
usual life stories of the masters, then I would have known them as well. Finally, I 
had to ask him, 'How do you know this in so much more detail than last yearr 

•Kyungtrul just chuckled, teJling me, i\JJ their Jives come marching straight out 
of the expanse of the aU-ground, like endless ripples on the surface of a great lake: 
That was aU he said.· 

Dzigar Kongtrul continued, ·As far as I'm concerned, there isn't so much as 
a hair tip's worth of difference between Kyungtrul and the great Marpa of the 
Kagyu lineage-except of course that Marpa was an expert in Sanskrit. When 
I read about Marpa the translator, his vast insight and accomplishment is fully 
matched by that of my teacher, Kyungtrul. But when it comes to insight into the 
tantras and pith instructions, I don't feel that I would get a superior teaching even 
if Marpa were to arrive in person. There is no difference between them-not even 
as much as a mustard seed's worth. 

·we know that Marpa is supposed to have attained accomplishment, but there 
is no doubt that this guy is realized too. Kyungtrul is a true hidden yogi-but the 
fact that he goes around hiding it doesn't change a thing. His clairvoyant powers 
are clear and precise. As far as I am concerned there is no master superior to him 
in this part of the world.• 

These were no small words coming from a teacher of Dzigar Kongtrul's caliber 
and sharpness, since his power of speech was incredible. Every sentence he spoke 
was like a sword cutting through the water, totally unimpeded- In that region of 
Kham, when it came to debate, whether on Sutra or Tantra, no one could keep up 
with him. He was also an expert in proverbs and colloquial sayings, and when he 
combined them with philosophical arguments, every opponent would go mute. 
It was hard to find a master as erudite as him. Yet he shared these words of high 
praise with me after Kyungtrul passed away. 

There was a special weight to his words because Kyungtrul was from Nangchen, 
not from Derge, which was known for its learned masters. If you look back through 
its entire history, Nangchen had very few great scholars. In fact, Old Khyentse 



Meetings with a Remarkable Teacher 253 

once said after a visit to Nangchen, •The monks over there don't even know how 
to wear their robes properly. They toss them on and wind up looking like they have 
a load on their back:' 

So considering where he came from, Dzigar Kongtrul's praise puts Kyungtrul 
eien higher. And yet, even this great master passed away. 

During our times together Kyungtrul told me quite a few stories, many from 
Tashi Ozer of Palpung, who himself had been a student of the three great mas-
ters-Khyentse, Kongtrul and Paltrul. These three masters were classmates at 
Shechen monastery.- Paltrul was from the Golok district, a land of virtuous high-
land nomads. His family was either poor or too far away to offer him any support, 
so he would often run out of provisions. 

Khyentse, however, was rather well-off due to his rich father, an aristocrat from 
a wealthy and powerful family. Kongtrul's family lived nearby and was fairly well-
off too. So Paltrul often ate the leftover tsampa balls from his friends' plates. 

After his meals Paltrul would lie down, covering his head with his monk's shawl. 
When Khyentse and Kongtrul would tell him he should study instead oflying down, 
Paltrul replied, •Why study? Isn't a human being just someone who can listen and 
speak? All I have to do is repeat what the teacher said. So why should I worry?• 

lfPaltrul were called upon to explain the topic from the previous day, he would 
repeat it almost verbatim and nearly better than the teacher himself. Though 
Kongtrul was the most diligent student and Khyentse seemed more intelligent, 
Paltrul was totally unimpeded. 

Paltrul once told Tashi Ozer, •Now, my son, you should be a renunciate. Live 
like a child of the mountains: wear the mist as your robes, keeping just a simple 
sheepskin coat; walk on foot with only a walking stick and forsake riding horse-
back. Give up all involvements and live like Milarepa!· 

Tashi Ozer agreed and gave away all his possessions to live as a wandering men-
dicant This is how he arrived at Dzongsar, where the great Khyentse resided. 

·"The famous scholar Tashi Ozer has arrived: the attendant announced, •and it 
looks like he is now a disciple of Paltrul:' 

"Put him up in the monks' quarters: Khyentse replied. 
A whole week went by and nothing happened, so Tashi Ozer thought perhaps 

he should take the initiative and go see the master; but the attendant told him just 
~stay in his room. 



254 EARLY YEARS 

•1 wonder what happened,• he thought. •Whenever I saw Khyentse Wangpo 
before, he treated me with special honor. Have I done anything to displease him? 
He couldn't be jealous of me; that's impossible. He must be doing this to purify my 
bad karma and obscurations~ 

Although he was a great lama in his own right, these doubts disturbed Tashi 
Ozer deeply. After a while he felt so miserable he began to cry. 

But soon after he was told to come into Khyentse's room. When he entered he 
saw that there was a throne next to Khyentse's and on the table was a complete 
monk's outfit: shawl, skirt, everything. 

·Hey, you!· Khyentse proclaimed. •At Palpung monastery you were awarded the 
rank of khenchen-great scholar-a great honor. What were you thinking when 
you threw that away to wear a stinky sheepskin? Take it off immediately and put 
on these robes!· 

•please don't force me; Tashi Ozer tried to object. 
•1f you hesitate one second longer, I'll use my stick on you!• Khyentse threat· 

ened. 
That was the last day he wore the old sheepskin coat. 

Once Paltrul said, •1 hear that Shabkar lives in the lower part of Golok.""' I am 
going to go meet him,· and he headed off. Along the way Paltrul met a man who 
asked where he was going. 

•1 am on my way to see Lama Shabkar; said Paltrul. 
·well, you are wasting your time. I have just come from there and even if you 

go, you will not be able to meet him for he has recently passed on:' Immediately 
Paltrul made one hundred full prostrations while chanting in sorrowful tones. 

Some time later, he remarked, •1 wanted to meet Lama Shabkar not because 
there was any teaching I needed to receive-I have nothing to ask of him, and he 
would have nothing to ask of me-but in the world today he was the one with the 
most authentic bodhisattva spirit. I felt what great merit it would be if I could see 
his face just once! 

·well then, there's nothing to be done. Let's turn around and go back. I have 
made a mandala offering by bowing one hundred times. That will have to suffice." 

One time, while Paltrul was living at Dzogchen monastery in Derge, Do 
Khyentse, another great master, came from the lower part of Kham to visit him. 
On his arrival Do Khyentse mentioned that he had set out that very same mom-



Meetings with a Remarkable Teacher 255 

ing, which was quite impossible since the journey typically took fifteen days on 
horseback. 

On the other hand, who knows-since Do Khyentse was capable of reviving 
the dead, like the great siddhas of India, and had done so on many occasions. 
For example, I've heard that he had a following in the form of a huge pack of wild 
meat-loving dogs. Sometimes, as a feast, he would carve the flesh off the bones of 
a deer and feed it to the dogs. 

Then he would tell his human disciples to pile the bones on the deer's skin, and 
as soon as he struck the skin with his staff, the deer would stand up and dart off. 
}his happened many times, and hunters began to routinely offer a few antelope 
or deer to the master and his disciples. They would eat the meat, and though 
Khampas enjoy taking the bones and sucking on the marrow, Do Khyentse for· 
bade them to. Instead they would collect the bones and pile them on each skin, 
and when Do Khyentse hit the skin with his staff, the deer would jump up and run 
off. 

But once, not realizing he wasn't supposed to, a new disciple cracked open a 
bone. Do Khyentse tried to stop him, but was too late. When they collected all the 
bones, they included the pieces from the new disciple and wrapped them up with 
the others in the hide. When Do Khyentse tapped the bundle with his staff, the 
deer staggered to its feet and hobbled off on a broken leg. 

Anyway, this was the Do Khyentse who had come to Derge to make sure 
Paltrul became his disciple. Upon his arrival, he promptly began circumambulat· 
ing the main temple counterclockwise, the opposite direction taken by everyone 
else, including Paltrul. Two people are bound to meet when circling in opposite 
directions. 

But the moment the two crossed paths, Do Khyentse yelled at Paltrul, ·You 
old dog! Charlatan! Fraud!• Not only did he hurl abuse on Paltrul, but he also 
sbpped him and when Paltrul tried to get up Do Khyentse knocked him back 
down. 

·It suddenly dawned on Paltrul that this stranger might be Do Khyentse. His 
next thought was, •This master is a heruka in person. Why is he abusing me?· 

Then, all of a sudden, his usual way of perceiving reality was brought to a com· 
plete halt. 

"That's it, Old Dog!• Do Khyentse yelled. •From now on, for you, that's it!• 
Paltrullater told Tashi Ozer, ·That was when I recognized the nature of mind 

ill its naked state, without the least clinging or concept. At that moment, 1 was 



256 EARLY YEARS 

brought face to face with the authentic awakened state. That's why I now use 'Old 
Dog' as my secret initiation name, since it was bestowed upon me by the great 
master Do Khyentse~ 

You could call that a very direct pointing-out instruction. 

Once, a yogi from Nangchen named Angi Tendar-who was not just an ordi-
nary practitioner but quite realized-went to see Paltrul. 

·Where are you from?· asked Paltrul. 
•I am a disciple ofTsoknyi in Nangchen.· 
·well, well. I have heard mention of this Tsoknyi ofNangchen who is supposed 

to have realized the view of the Great Perfection. Isn't he the one who is so fond 
of teaching in a way that, as Milarepa said, 'If you practice in the morning, you 
are a buddha in the morning, and if you practice at night, you are a buddha at 
night-and the destined person of karmic fortune becomes a buddha even with-
out meditating'? 

·u this is your teacher, tell me: How many of his disciples have attained the 
rainbow body?• Paltrul teased. 

·There was one who would have attained the rainbow body; Tendar replied, "if 
he hadn't passed away from badly infected boils~ 

Now there is no way in the world any illness can prevent an advanced practitio-
ner from attaining the rainbow body, so for a moment Paltrul was left speechless. 

Then they both burst out laughing. 

The quote Paltrul used came from Milarepa's life story. Before Milarepa met 
Marpa, he had requested instructions from a Dzogchen master. 

•you seem to be a formidable practitioner; the master told Milarepa. ·Therefore, 
I will give you my Dzogchen teachings, which brings liberation through seeing, 
hearing and remembering~ And he told him the very words Paltrul had repeated, 
about becoming a buddha in the morning or the night. 

The real meaning of this instruction is that whenever one remembers to rec-
ognize the awakened state, that moment is in essence identical with that of the 
Buddha, be it morning or night. What's more, recognition of the natural state is 
not an act of meditating; anyone capable of training in this is therefore said to be-
come ·a buddha without meditating.• This is true for someone who not only rec-
ognizes the awakened state authentically, but also trains in it continuously. That 
is what is meant by ·destined person of karmic fortune:" (In the past, Shechen 



Meetings with a Remarkable Teacher 257 

Kongtrul also gave me the instruction, •Hey, you, don't meditate, don't meditate!• 
meaning that the awakened state is not an act of meditating.) 

Unfortunately, what Milarepa understood from the Dzogchen teacher was that 
he was such a special person that there was no need for him to even train in the 
t.ature of mind. He misunderstood the meaning of simplicity and spent a week just 
taking it easy. 

On the eighth day the Dzogchen master called him back in and asked, ·Explain 
to me your present experience and understanding~ 

"What experience and understanding?• replied Milarepa. •I don't have any. You 
.said that someone like me doesn't need to practice, so I didn't~ 

"Oh my!• the master exclaimed. •It seems I gave away the highest teachings too 

:soon! 1 don't think I can help you now. But in the Drowo valley to the south of here 
!n·es the great translator Marpa, a yogi of the new transmission of Vajrayana. You 
and he have a karmic link, so go see him:' 
, The very moment Milarepa heard Marpa's name, he was thrilled to the bone, so 

that every hair on his body tingled and his eyes filled with tears. That was a sure 
sign of a karmic connection. Immediately Milarepa asked to be excused and set 
off to find Marpa. 

One day, a dead man was brought before Paltrul for the necessary rituals. But 
after the bereaved family had left with the corpse, Paltrul burst out laughing. 
Surprised at this, one of his disciples asked why he was so amused. 

"When I first saw the family I felt like crying. Just yesterday this man had come 
to see me, alive and well. Then today his poor family brings in his lifeless body, dull 
and bloated. How sad it was to see his wretched face. 

"But when I looked from the state of meditation to see where his spirit had 
gone, I saw that he had already taken rebirth in a god realm.- He is a joyful little 
child with a beautiful face, sitting on his mother's lap. Samsara is truly strange! His 
relatives are still crying and yet he is full of joy-what a strange world!" 

Another day a disciple asked him, •Rinpoche, how many past lives do you re-
memberr 

"1 can't see as dearly as the great bodhisattvas nor am I able to see countless 
lives like the Buddha could. But 1 could give you details of at least five hundred. 
Also, if I really had to, I could tell you what will happen in my next five hundred~ 

When a master of Paltrul's caliber gave teachings on the nature of sarnsara and 
reality, it wasn't merely dry words. 



258 EARLY YEARS 

Every afternoon Paltrul was in the habit of chanting the famous aspiration for 
rebirth in the realm of Buddha Amitabha. He usually sang it outside at a gentle 
pace, while prostrating in the direction of the setting sun. 

One day, upon returning, he told a disciple, "I just heard some very bad news.· 
"What was it, Rinpoche?" 
"I met an ant who told me 'Paltrul is about to die: Do you know how to chant 

the ejection of consciousness according to Longclren Nyingtig?" 
"Of course," replied the disciple. 
"Please sing it for me, then:' 
At the end of the chant, the disciple uttered PHAT three times and on the third 

one, Paltrulleft his body. 

Near the end of his life, tiny white pearls, or ringsel, occasionally fell from 
Kyungtrul's face. Sometimes people mentioned this to him, but they would soon 
regret it because his only response was, "What an evil sign-you can also find 
such ringsel in pigs. It's surely bad luck when someone who is still alive leaves 
relics. Who ever heard of that? Get rid of them immediately! Just throw them 
outside. And don't ever bring this up again! .. 

That's what he said, but think about it-isn't it a bit strange? So people would 
collect the ringsel without him knowing, filtering his urine and the water he used 
to wash his face in order to find them. They even found that his feces were full of 
ringsel. 

Kyungtrul appeared to have totally transcended the state of delusion. He was aJ. 
ways calm and smiling-he never even let on when he was seriously ill. He passed 
away at a monastery near Lachab. 

The day before leaving his body, he told his disciples to perform a particu· 
lar ritual for the guardians of the Dharma, saying, "The wisdom protectors \\ill 
guide you in this life, in the bardo and in the next life. So now, please perform the 
Mending of the Sacred Link on my behalf. 

"The most impressive way to die: Kyungtrul continued, "is like the Chokling 
of Neten. He was on his way back from a visit to Riwoche and on the road he saw 
a tiny hermitage up on the hillside. He asked to be taken there. The next day, he 
quietly let his mind dissolve into the basic space of all phenomena. There was 
not a single sound of wailing or crying around him, and nobody pestered him to 
remain. He passed on in an atmosphere of complete tranquility. When one dies, 
that's how it should be done. And you, my disciples, try to leave this life in the 
same way:' 



Meetings with a Remarkable Teacher 259 

The next morning they found that their master had passed away. 

!didn't know it then but those days with Kyungtrul would mark my last extended 
stay in Nangchen. Right after, I returned to Central Tibet to receive the Treasury of 
Precious Termas, and began serving the Karmapa more and more. And, as I came 
to realize, Tibet as I knew it was soon going to be changed forever.

the J(armapa 

When Karsey Kongtrul visited Lachab, I requested a letter from him telling me to 

attend the empowerments of the Treasury of Precious Term as that he was going to 
~ve at Tsurphu. As he was the greatest among all the Kagyu masters of the time, 

my monastery had no choice but to let me go. 
When I appeared at Tsurphu, he showed great delight in seeing me again and 

said that although he had no ambition to be someone who gave the extraordi-
nary Treasury of Precious Termas, nevertheless he felt obligated to do so as the 
Karmapa had asked him to. 

·Then he added, "Since you are here, I feel more enthusiastic; there seems to be 

a purpose to it now." He frequently spoke to me with such affection. I stayed there 
for the seven months it took to complete all the empowerments. 

Kongtrul had extremely high realization, and one got the impression that he 

\\'aS definitely someone who had reached the level known as the collapse of delu-
sion. Every afternoon following the empower-

ments, he would take a stroll, circumambulating 
the main temples. It seemed to me that his body 
was moving while his mind never left the state 

ofsamadhi. 
When he spoke, it was mostly about practice 

and how to develop further. 

I'm not sure what his experience was, but 

sometimes he would leave his shawl and most of 

his robes behind while walking to his chamber 
and arrive in only his undergarments. 

"Rinpoche! What happened? What are you 
doing?" one of his attendants would ask. 

"What do mean?''

·You took off your clothes on the way in~ 
•I thought I was already home; Karsey Kongtrul would reply. 
Don't get me wrong here; he wasn't just eccentric-he was extremely realized. 

This odd behavior was just a peculiarity of the collapse of delusion, which he 
reached a few years before he passed away. 

At the end of the empowerments I asked Karsey Kongtrul for permission tore-
main at Tsurphu in retreat for three years, and he happily agreed to write another 
letter to my monastery to make this possible. 

In those days I was quite shy and didn't feel I should impose myself on such a 
great master, so I only saw him when he specifically asked for me. However, on our 

. last walk together, he confided in me what his experience was. This was something 
he would never state in public, but for some reason he trusted me. 

•What I am about to say is straight and honest talk,• he began. ·The fifteenth 
Karmapa, Khakyab Dorje, was the one who pointed out the nature of my mind. 

He told me to refrain from extensive study: he said that although there are many 
important streams of teachings kept alive in eastern Tibet, as he put it, 'You have 
to uphold the teachings of the ultimate transmission.210 Therefore, as your main 
practice, simply sustain the continuity of the natural state that I have shown you-
don't try to be a great scholar: That is the command my father, the Karmapa, gal'e 
me. So except for grammar and spelling I haven't studied much. 



At Tsurphu with the Karmapa 265 

.'Nevertheless, from training in the natural state, I have reached a level where the 

entire valley of Tsurphu appears as the mandala of Chakrasamvara and with each 
~ing day conceptual thoughts arc fewer and farther between. Now there is only 
one problem left: I still lose presence of mind in the moment of falling asleep. It lasts 
oo more than a couple of seconds, but I am sorry to admit I do become unaware. 

'Apart from that, this mind no longer gets distracted at any time, day or night. 
The view is wide open and continuous, and there is no parting from it. I'm telling 
f?U this in private; until today I haven't mentioned it to anyone else. I am now 
ronfident that I can die at any moment and not be in trouble: 

That's how he spoke. Later it turned out that these were also his parting re-

ri!arks to me, because I didn't see him again before my return to Kham. And it also 
seems an indication that he knew his death was imminent. 

After the empowerments, I went into retreat high up the mountain above 
Tsurphu monastery, at a beautiful cave known as Lotus Garuda Fortress. The her-
:antage had an impressive view and had been the hermitage of many past incar-
nations of the Kagyu lineage masters .... The Karmapa gave me his permission to 
~y there, as well as providing a servant. He also very kindly sent builders up to 

ronstruct some extra rooms for my retreat. 
\Thile I was in retreat at Tsurphu, as it happened, my oldest son, Chok.-yi Nyima, 

was born. At the time ChOkyi Nyima's mother, Kunsang Dechen, was staying near 
the monastery of his previous incarnation.m 

Actually, ever since I was a young boy, I had felt 

quite bashful and shy in general. For instance, in the 

rountryside, people usually go a little distance from 
the house to relieve themselves. But if a house was 
surrounded by open fields, I found it very difficult 

~do so with people watching. So I would wander 
offlooking for someplace more private. Sometimes 
a benefactor would think I was leaving or going for 
·a stroll and would chase after me to find out where · 

I was going-how I wished they would go away! But 
oicoursc they had no idea. so they would just trot 
along until finally I would have to return to their 
!rose with a full bladder. Then I'd wait for my next 
dunce to sneak out, this time without an escort. 
That kind of bashfulness can be very inconvenient.

266 CENTRAL TIBET 

In the early part of my life, I also had been very shy around people of the op-
posite sex-1 almost didn't dare to look at women except from a distance. I think I 
was in my early twenties before 1 had my first girlfriend. It never entered my mind 
to get married, but neither was I interested in being a monk. 

Anyway, I met Kunsang Dechen while in Central Tibet and she returned with 
me to Kham, slowly becoming known as my consort. This was several years before 
Chokyi Nyima was born. She was quite a practitioner and had already completed 
the preliminary practices thirteen times. People were very impressed by her per-
severance. Imagine doing one million three hundred thousand prostrations! Her 
family had a lot of cattle, and she would take all the excess butter and send it to 
Lhasa to offer butter lamps in sets of one hundred thousand, one after the other. 

Now that the truth was out that I was not a monk, 1lost some of my shyness.! 
even slowly overcame my reluctance to look women in the eye. 

Near the end of my retreat, 1 received a letter from Karsey Kongtrul telling me 
to return to Lachab. The people at my monastery must have pressed him to send 
this letter, because he mentioned that they were in desperate need of funds. It 
seems Sam ten Gyatso's tulku was still too young to take responsibility, some of the 
buildings needed repairs and the main lama-me-was off in Central Tibet. 

Karsey Kongtrul's letter said, •your monastery is pushing very hard. It appears 

there is no way you can avoid visiting Kham one more time. So please go back 
there as soon as your three-year retreat is over~ 

1 did not want to disobey Karsey Kongtrul. Besides, the political situation in 
Tibet was steadily deteriorating and I felt a pressing need to visit Kham anyway. So 
when my retreat was over, I asked the Karmapa for permission to return to Lachab 
and began to prepare for the long journey back to Kham. Yet it turned out there 
was something else I had to do before going. 

Years earlier, as I mentioned, Samten Gyatso had given the New Treasures at 
Surmang monastery in Nangchen. On that occasion, many of the extremely real-
ized masters of the Kagyu lineage had come to receive these transmissions from 
him. As was usual, however, Sam ten Gyatso had kept some of the important em-
powerments secret-including the 1hree Sections of the Great Perfection-and 
hadn't transmitted them. 

Later on, Surmang Tentrul and Karsey Kongtrul transmitted much of what they 
had received to the young Karmapa. Yet there were still six volumes missing-
those that Samten Gyatso had withheld at Surmang-and the Karmapa was very 
determined to possess the complete lineage of the New Treasures. Apparently, he 



At Tsurphu with the Karmapa 267 

had singled me out to offer him the rest. Once when we had met in Nangchen, the 
Kmnapa had asked me to bring those books along to Tsurphu on my next visit, 
hinting, "It is possible that someday you may need to give me the empowerments 
br the 1hree Sections.· 

"That is completely out of the question; 1 replied. "I couldn't possibly do that!• 
·Why?• the Karmapa responded. "This lineage is still unbroken.· 
l tried to put up an argument, •It has two lines, one through Tsewang Norbu 

to the two incarnations of Chokgyur Lingpa and my uncles Sam ten Gyatso and 
Tersey. The other lineage comes through Tsewang Norbu to the great master Katok 
Situ and Dzongsar Khyentse. These lineages are still alive. Even though Samten 
Gyatso passed it on to my father and me, the lamas who received it through Katok 
Situ are still alive. 

•5o there is no reason you should depend on someone like me,· I continued. 
1 neither understand it nor know how to pass it on. But next time I return from 
Kham, I will make sure to bring a copy of the scripture, as well as the necessary 
[ons, as an offering to you:" 

Years later, on my way to Central Tibet, I mentioned the Karmapa's remarks to 
my uncle Tersey. Later, Uncle Tersey wrote me, •My mother, the terton's daugh-
ter Konchok Paldron, said that after three generations, the seal of secrecy would 
be naturally lifted. At that time there will no longer be any fault in propagating 
the Three Sections more widely. These were the words of the great terton himself. 
The three generations are to be counted as first Tsewang Norbu, second Sam ten 
~yatso, and the third one appears to be you. So you must fulfill the Karmapa's 
i:ommand!• 

!fit weren't for this letter, I would not have had the courage to pass these teach-
ings on, but instead would have insisted on waiting for Uncle Tersey to come.111 

Anyway, one day at Tsurphu I had received the message that the Karmapa 
II"Wted to see me right away. When I arrived at his quarters, the Karmapa told me 
that I had to give him the empowerments for the 1hree Sections. I was astonished 
.md objected, •How can I do that? I'm nothing special. Don't ask me to do such a 
lhing." 

I noticed that a small stack of thick cushions covered with a huge tiger skin had 
been set up beside his seat. I also noted that the copy of the 1hree Sections that I 
bad brought was alrt>ady lying open on a decorated table in front of the cushions. 

Then the Karmapa commanded, ·sit down! Begin with the reading transmis-
don right now. Then start with the first empowerment tomorrow. I need to go to 
Sky Lake soon, so make sure you finish everything by then:" 



268 CENTRAL TIBET 

The shrine had been arranged and the mandala laid out, and the shrine master 
was already holding the plate with the mandala offering. Before I knew what was 
happening, they had begun the offering chant and the Karmapa had placed a large 
gold coin in the middle of the mandala plate. 

•It is my custom always to offer gold when I request an important Dzogchen 
empowerment or make a new Dharma connection; he said. Then he signaled me 
to start. 

·You can't force me to create the negative karma of placing myself above the 
Karmapa,· I protested. ·There is no tradition that allows an ordinary person like 
myself to confer an empowerment upon a Buddha such as yourself.' I pleaded over 

and over again to be excused. 
The Karmapa took on a wrathful air, •I have never met anyone as stubborn as 

you! I don't know anyone who refuses my wishes; everyone always listens! I'm ask· 
ing you to give an empowerment-isn't that a sign of my respect? But alii get in 
return is your refusal. How can anyone be like this?· He looked quite displeased. ·• 

In spite of this, I bowed down once more and said, •ptease, don't force me! The 
line of transmission need not be broken just because I don't give it; there are great· 
er lamas in Kham who can offer this empowerment, like Dzongsar Khyentse.114 

In this present age you won't find any master in these parts greater than him! You 
only need to send a letter and there's no doubt he would come. I1l be _happy to 
carry the letter; when I get back to Kham, I'll go straight to Derge to deliver it" 
Again I bowed down. 

The Karmapa then said, ·rve had great hopes that you would give me this trans: 
mission. Don't refuse me. This is not just some whim. Not only are you a descen-
dant of Chokgyur Lingpa, you are also a tulku. I chose you only after careful con· 
side ration. When I ask someone to give me a transmission, they are not supposed 
to refuse. You are the first ever to do so!• 

He stamped on the floor furiously, red-faced. 
The Karmapa's attendant, the Tsurphu vajra master, with whom I got along 

really well, had been frantically signaling to me to come over to him, out of ear-
shot. Obviously he knew the Karmapa was quite displeased and didn't dare to 
approach. 

·can't you see that our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel has become quite displeased?" 
the attendant whispered. ·Yet you still refuse to relent? Don't you understand that 
going against him will cause a rift in your relationship and damage your samaya 
with him? Unless you offer to give him the empowerment, how can you still claim 
to have pure samaya with the Karmapa? This will make it difficult for you to come 
back here-please reconsider! Please begin the transmission right now!

·Now the Karmapa turned around and said sternly, 
'\fell then, what's it going to be? Will you start now?· 

Somehow, "Certainly, Rinpoche!· just slipped out. I 
rook a seat below his throne and prepared to begin. s•s 

"Do you really think you can give the precious Great

Perfection from the floor; the Karmapa objected, "as if water could flow uphillr 
So I was finally forced to sit on a throne. The shrine master began to chant the 

~dala offering a second time and I began the reading transmission, which took 
two days. 

When I finished it, the Karmapa said, "It's now time to begin the empower-
l!lent! Today is a good day, let's start this evening:' 

"Oh dread!" 1 thought. The Karmapa had already called in the shrine masters 
and ordered them to begin preparing the tormas. We began with the empower-
ment for Shri Singha, the Indian master who is central to the Dzogchen lineage. 

Only five days were left until our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel had to leave for Sky 
.take in northern Tibet. Since I had no shrine master experienced in this trans-
,mission-just an old monk from Lachab-every night I had to piece together the 
empowerment manuals for the next day. By the end, I was so exhausted from lack 
lisleep that my urine turned red with blood. 

When it was over I needed a good rest. But the Karmapa had other plans, "You 
must accompany me on the journey to Sky Lake, so that every morning and eve-
. Ding you can continue giving me the remaining empowerments from the New 
Treasures:' 
.He also wanted me to give the entrustment to the life force of Tseringma, the 

imale guardian of Chokgyur Lingpa's treasures. I took the bursar aside and asked 
lit would be all right to offer them at a later date and begin my journey back 
tD,Kham. Every morning and evening droves of people would flock to see the 
K:rmapa, and there would be absolutely no opportunity for me to offer him the 
rdlsmissions. 



270 CENTRAL TIBET 

Many extraordinary things happened in the company of the Karmapa. For ex-
ample, he kept hundreds of birds. Karsey Kongtrul had given him a bird with an 
extremely melodious voice, which was very dear to him. When this bird got sick, 
he kept it alone in a special room. One day he was told that the bird was dying and 
he asked that it be brought to him. 

The bird was placed on the table before him. 
"This bird needs a special blessing~ he said. So he took a small vessel with mus· 

tard seeds and made his usual chant for dispelling obstacles as he threw some of 
the grains on the bird. Suddenly he said, "There's nothing more to do-it is dying. 
No blessing can prevent it~ 

Then he turned to me, saying, "Pick it up and hold it in your hand~ 
The bird was still alive and it sat there in my palm with one eye half-open. 

But soon I saw its head slump, then its wings. But, strangely enough, the bird 
then straightened back up and simply sat there. An attendant whispered, •It's in 
samadhi!• 

1 didn't want to disturb it, so I asked him to put it on the table. The attendant 
seemed used to handling birds in this state, because he didn't disturb it as he put 
the bird down. 

Somewhat astonished, I commented to the attendant, "How remarkable! A bird 
that sits up straight right after death!?!• 

"That's nothing special. They all do it~ he replied matter-of-factly. 
A second attendant chimed in, "Every single bird from the Karmapa's aviary 

that dies sits up for a while after death. But we're so used to this, it has ceased to 
amaze us~ 

"When birds die; I objected, "they keel over and fall off their branch to the 
ground-they don't keep sitting!• 

"Well, when the Karmapa is around, this is what they do; replied the attendant 
·But you're right-when he's away, they die the normal way~ 

At this point everyone had arrived for dinner and I had to sit down, however) 
couldn't help keeping my eye on the bird while we ate. Halfway through diMerits 
right wing slumped and soon after the left followed. 

An attendant whispered, "Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, it seems the samadhi is about 
to finis~ 

The Karmapa paid no attention and kept eating, even when the bird finally 
keeled over. I looked at my watch-approximately three hours had gone by. No 
matter what the attendants said, I was still pretty amazed because I saw it die in 
my hands. Most people probably wouldn't believe this unless they saw it with their 
own eyes. 



At Tsurplm with the Karmapa 271 

The Karmapa was very fond of dogs as well and he had several Pekingese that, 
I was told, also died sitting up with their forelegs parallel. 

In short, the Karmapa was an incredible human being. 

The Karmapa was so busy those days that I never was able to continue the 
~powerments. Then a well-timed letter from Uncle Tersey asking me to return 
to Nangchen offered me a graceful excuse to leave. And so I was temporarily 
excused. 

After leaving Tsurphu I took the northern route that went by Drong monas-
tery. Kunsang Dechen was staying near there with my first son. Chokyi Nyima 
~os the reincarnation of the head lama, Tendzin Dorje, who had been a close 
disciple of the great master Shakya Shri and a dear friend of my uncle Tersey. 
He was also a disciple of Sam ten Gyatso, having spent at least four months with 
bim."' 

Tendzin Dorje once told me about the time he went to see Tsewang Norbu in 
Lhasa. 

"Knowing that this master was the son and close disciple of Chokgyur Lingpa, 
I had sincerely looked forward to meeting him. I sat down with others in the wait-
ing room when all of a sudden a tall, naked man comes out of Tsewang Norbu's 
room and stomps across the wooden floor headed directly for the toilet, his tes-

.ticles swaying with each step. You should have seen the Lhasa women and their 
young daughters scampering to get out of the way!• 

The others ran out of the room, but Tendzin Dorje-who was very open-mind-
ed and not an ardent admirer of superficial etiquette-just kept sitting. A few 
·~$lutes later the naked man stomped back through the room. A short time later 
Tendzin Dorje was shown into the master's room only to discover that the naked 
. aim was no other than Tsewang Norbu himself. 

In his area, Tendzin Dorje was known as the Black Jambhala, the god of wealth, 
and it was said that whoever had the fortune to invite him to their home would be-
mme rich. Tendzin Dorje was someone with a ·lucky hand; meaning that old and 
f!ecious things always seemed to end up in his possession. His monastic house-
lk1!d was considered extremely well-to-do. Tendzin Dorje himself was the owner 
~at least one thousand fine horses; at the time of the communist takeover, there 
't!We still five hundred horses left. 

While Tendzin Dorje was the head lama, Drong monastery was known to pos-
sess some of the finest dance costumes west of Kham; they were used in extensive 
rituals and sacred dances ... ,

The young 

When the communists took over they confiscated all the costumes of fine bro-
cade and all the yellow hats used in ceremonies, as well as the other ritual imple· 
ments and burned them all in one big pile. 

I had been at Drong monastery for a just a few months when a messenger ar· 
rived saying that the Karmapa was ordering me to return to Tsurphu. It was •time 
to give the remaining empowerments~ So I headed back to finish the task. 

Meanwhile Karsey Kongtrul had begun a three-year retreat when he received 
the news that his close friend and disciple had passed away in Nangchen.'11 He 
tried to be excused from attending the funeral ceremonies, but the messengers 
wouldn't accept his refusal. When he finally consented to leave retreat and go to 
Kham, he warned, ·All right, if I must then I shall. But I won't return to Central 
Tibet.• 

While Karsey Kongtrul was in Kham, I was with the Karmapa back at Tsurphu.' 
One day the Karmapa suddenly exclaimed, ·Tulku! I just had a very bad dream. I 
can't possibly pretend that it's good: 

•What was it?• I asked. 
•1 saw that a stupa made of pure crystal descended from the vast reaches of space: 

Inside the sphere of the stupa I could clearly see a statue of Buddha Shakyamuni 
made of pure gold. In my dream I stood up with the intention of taking hold of the 
statue. But, just as it was about to land, it rose again. There was no chance; it was 
already out of reach and soon vanished into the depths of space. 

•1n this life, I regard two masters as my root gurus. One is the Situ of Palpung 
and when he passed away I had a similar, in· 
auspicious dream. This morning's dream 
made me wonder if my other root guru hasn't 
passed on as well; he remarked, referring to 
Karsey Kongtrul. 

Of course I tried to reassure him that 
this probably wasn't the case, but he replied, 
•No, my heart is uneasy. It definitely wasn't a 

good dream. I fear that my loving protector is 
gone: 

Dalai Lama ....;,;;;.&~o,~~ 

Several weeks later, the Karmapa went to 
Lhasa to visit the Dalai Lama at the Potala and 
to receive several empowerments from the old 
Kadam tradition from him. The Karmapa also 



At Tsurphu with the Karmapa 273 

sponsored the grand empowerment of Kalachakra at Norbu Lingka Park and I ac-
rompanied him as his assistant. While preparing to leave Tsurphu, the Karmapa 
told- his personal attendant, •Make sure you bring the guru sadhana of Marpa, 
Milarepa, and Gampopa; the three forefathers of the Kagyu lineage. 

But sometimes the monks at Tsurphu were quite the independent thinkers. 
\nen the attendant left the anteroom, he wondered, ·What's the use of bringing 
that t~ to Lhasa? He's about to receive the Kalachakra from the Dalai Lama. I 
don't know of any custom allowing private rituals while partaking in a grand em-
po.,.,-erment.• 

l pointed out that if our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel told him to do something, he 
simply had to do it. But he balked, objecting, •What possible reason could there be 
br taking that text?• Later that day, the Karmapa asked him once again if he had 
packed the text. The attendant lied, saying he had. In an aside to me, he repeated, 
'There's no way he'll need that text:' 

Again I had to tell him, ·oon't talk like that! If he asks you to do something, just 
00 it!" 

The next morning, just as we were about to leave, the Karmapa asked yet again, 
'Now, you have brought that text-haven't you?· 

The attendant replied, ·or course I have:' Then he went outside and said to me, 
"Ihat's the third time he's mentioned it!• 

l warned him he better bring the text or he would get into a lot of trouble in 
Utasa. He said, ·okay, I can carry it! What's the big deal?" Then he went off and 
brought the text. 

Down in lhasa, grand arrangements were under way for the Kalachakra em-
powerment. All the dignitaries of Central Tibet had assembled for this important 
ociasion. The ceremonies would take five or six days. 

We arrived a few days early. The Karmapa was one of the few masters in Tibet 
ilvested by the government with the special honor of traveling under the •parasol 
lithe Dharma,• a dignified procession accompanied by great fanfare, as he did on 
his visit to the Jokhang. Besides the Karmapa, only the Dalai lama, the head of 
tbe Sak-ya School, the throne holder of Ganden, and a very few select others could 
be shown this honor inside the city of lhasa. Otherwise, there was a prohibition 
l¢nst honoring one's lama with such lavish signs of respect. 

The Karmapa visited the Jowo statue, where he made copious offerings of but-
terlamps. On his way back, he was invited to dine at the family home of Karsey 
longtrul's mother, the respected consort of the fifteenth Karmapa. 

The bursar and chief steward of Tsurphu were all seated for a meal when-
against all the mores and etiquette of Central Tibet-a red-faced and exhausted 



274 CENTRAL TIBET 

Khampa burst into the house. He could be heard saying he had just ridden in from 
Thrangu Gompa and had an urgent message. 

"Hey!" he exclaimed. "Karsey Kongtrul has died! I and two others were immedi· 
ately dispatched to tell you. I have here his seal, stamped on this scarf, to prove it I 
used it to switch horses along the way, so it only took us twenty days to get here:•• 
We arrived in Lhasa this morning and were told this is his family's house. We also 
heard that the Karmapa is here, so let us in to see him right away!• 

One of the Tsurphu officials tried to hush him. "Could you please lower your 
voice and be quiet?• They immediately ushered the messengers into another room 
under the pretext of serving them a meal. 

Apparently Karsey Kongtrul had begun the ceremonies upon arrival at Thrangu 
Gompa. Then one day he went to spend a few days at the nearby cave of the fa-
mous Mipham and it was there that he had passed away. 

The bursar reasoned, "We can't tell the Karmapa this bad news just now. This 
is surely not the time or place. It's the Jamgon's family home,· he said referring to 
Karsey Kongtrul. "I suggest we wait until after the Karmapa has met with the Dalai 
Lama-otherwise their meeting will be very inauspicious. I know that our WISh-
Fulfilling Jewel will be deeply upset; I saw that when the Situ of Palpung passed 
away. We cannot tell him now!· 

So, the two officials prevented the sad news from being conveyed. They de; 
cided that the messengers should go somewhere else for a time, and then tell the 
Karmapa after he had met with the Dalai Lama. 

The next day, after the meeting, I advised them, "You can't delay this any longer, 
or our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel will give you a severe reprimand. It would be best to 
tell him tonight, or tomorrow morning at the latest:" 

Dudjom Rinpoche was in China at this time, and so we stayed at his house that 
night, where the Karmapa was shown great hospitality. But the next day I discov· 
ered that the officials still hadn't broken the news. 

"If you don't tell him now; I scolded them, "I'm not going to stick around and 
be party to your timidity:" 

"Please don't go!• they pleaded. "If you do, we'll be sent to look for you:" 
When the officials finally told the Karmapa, they got a well-deserved tongue-

lashing for their presumptuousness. 
One of them implored, "Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, please don't be so upset!· 
"You are going to tell me what to be upset about?• the Karmapa retorted. "I'm 

not upset like a worldly person. I'm upset for the beings of this time who don't 
have the merit to keep such a great master! Karsey Kongtrul was truly a master 
who had transcended delusion-a rare master indeed! During his final years, 



At Tsurplm with the Karmapa 275 

he fully matched the example for realization set by the masters of the Kagyu 
lineage:' 

Then he began to weep for quite some time. 
Meanwhile, just outside his room, many government officials had taken seats, 

awaiting an audience. Foremost among them was the regent of Tibet, who holds 
the highest political office. When he prostrates, even the Dalai Lama and the 
Karmapa have to stand as a sign of respect. 

Government officials in Lhasa can be quite arrogant and pushy, but the 
Karmapa's attendants didn't dare bring them in just then, thinking it would be 
inappropriate for them to see the Karmapa's tears. 

But at my request he wiped his eyes before receiving the first dignitary, so as 
not to be misunderstood by worldly people. 

The Karmapa's first response to the sad news was to send a gift of condolence to 
Karsey Kongtrul's elderly mother and the rest of his family. Then he said to his at-
tendant, •1 told you to bring a guru sadhana of Marpa, Milarepa, and Gampopa-
doyou have it?" 

"Of course, Wish-Fulfilling Jewel!" the attendant was able to reply, honestly this 
time. 

"Set up a shrine and perform it every third day from now on; the Karmapa 
ordered. 

That was a good lesson in why one should always do whatever the Karmapa 
asks, no matter what. 

After the Kalachakra was over I asked to be excused for my journey back to 
Kham. Once again the Karmapa revealed his clairvoyant abilities when he asked 
me where I intended to stay upon my return there. 

Now, the Karmapa wasn't just an ordinary person, so I figured his question 
must have some special significance. 

"WISh-Fulfilling Jewel, I'm going to stay at Fortress Peak. You remember the 
place; you stayed there for a week when you visited Kham:' 

"You won't stay there," the Karmapa replied. "Just you wait and see. I swear you 
won't!• 

The Karmapa spoke in plain language and used Khampa slang for swearing, "If 
fm wrong, I'll take on all of your bad karma:' What he meant was that he was one 
lumdred percent certain. 

Being rather obstinate I still had no doubt that I would stay there, since I could 
see nothing to prevent it. But the Karmapa insisted, "I'm telling you, you won't be 



276 CENTRAL TIBET 

able to stay there. Listen to me, you have to come back to Central Tibet as soon as 
you can! You must not stay in Kham!· 

The next day, when 1 asked to be excused, the Karmapa insisted, ·oon't go to 
Kham this year. But if you feel you really must go, then don't stay for long-just 
long enough to pack your belongings and return here.• 

Again 1 extolled the virtues of my retreat place at Fortress Peak, •My plan is to 
stay in retreat there for the rest of my life~ 

•I know,· the Karmapa warned, ·but you'll never get the chance to do it It will 
never happen~ 

·There is one way to make it possible; 1 replied. ·Fortress Peak is the special 
place for performing the longevity rituals for the king of Nangchen, and he always 
sponsors either Samten Gyatso or me, with a few attendants. He covers all expens-
es for food and ceremonies. Right now I secretly have another lama in my place 
covering for me. The royal court of Nangchen doesn't know that I'm in Central 
Tibet, and they would be very upset if they found out. The king would be angry 
and make my life difficult. 

·aut once I return 1 will be head of the monastery, and so I will be in charge of 
my life. That's why 1 know that I'll be able to stay in retreat~ 

•That's what you think; the Karmapa persisted, ·but you won't be able to!" 
The next day the Karmapa asked me, ·where do you plan on staying when you 

return to Kham?· 
1 blurted out that 1 was intent on staying at Fortress Peak. 
·ay the Three Jewels! You'll see-it will never happen!· 
•Why not? I am a Nangchen lama and no lama can live there without following 

the king's wishes. Sam ten Gyatso's tulku is still very young, so there is only me to 
perform the rituals. I cannot possibly abandon Fortress Peak until he is older." 

·Just the same, you won't stay there~ 
When I started to object yet again, he simply said, ·well, well! Then we11 just 

have to wait and see who is right!• 
On the eve of my departure, the Karmapa told me, •tet's be careful about part-

ing tomorrow. Twice in the past when I bid my teachers farewell, things didn't tum 
out so well. First it was with the precious Situ. 1 followed him along the way in an 
elaborate parting ceremony, but I never met him again. Then I did the same with 
Karsey Kongtrul and I never saw him again either. Therefore I think it would be 
better if we said good-bye this evening. So don't come to see me in the morning~ 

As a farewell present he gave me twelve yaks of the small but sturdy Central 
Tibetan type. Then he repeated, ·Make sure you come back to Central Tibet as 
soon as possible. You may think that you can practice in Kham, but I'm telling 



At Tsurpltu witlt tlte Karmapa 277 

rou it would be better for you to do retreat at Tsurphu! I'll be sending you a let-
!er-make sure you come as soon as you get it!• 

The next morning I started off for Kham, still firm in my belief that l was going 
to end my days in retreat at my beautiful hermitage Fortress Peak. 

Immediately upon arriving in Kham, I began making arrangements for my re-
treat. Fortress Peak was about a day's journey from Lachab where Sam ten Gyatso's 
young tulku was staying at the time.uo His father was an influential governor in . 
Kham, a good-hearted man, but also attached to the belief that his family and po-
~tion were of immense importance. Not long after I had begun retreat, he began 
to meddle. He felt that there was much work to be done at the monastery and 
didn't want to burden his son with all these managerial responsibilities. 

"The young tulku should be the one to stay at Fortress Peak,• he wrote me. 
1eing the older lama, you should reside at Lachab so that you can take better care 
of monastery affairs, rather than just staying carefree in the mountains, having 
yourself a good old time:' 

I gave the excuse that I had to do the ceremonies for the king of Nangchen. "It's 
better for me to be in a mountain retreat and fine for the tulku to live in the mon-
astery. 111 take care of business from here:' 

The governor sent back the message implying that it was impossible for me to 
take care of affairs from Fortress Peak and that he would not allow me to do as I 
wanted. 

"Why not?• I countered. "How can the tulku perform ceremonies for the king? 
fm the only one who can do them properly. Do you want me to go against our 
king? That won't be good for either of us:' 

"No: he replied, "the tulku should stay at Fortress Peak. I'll send up a lama to do 
the longevity practice. I want the tulku to stay there and you are welcome to come 
back down to the monastery:' 

To back-up his argument, he now started to quote other lamas including his 
brother, "I have just been to Dilyak monastery and discussed this with Sabchu 
Rinpoche, and he completely agrees with me!· 

His attitude was starting to annoy me. I retorted, "Isn't it the case that someone 
. t.ho is about to stay in long retreat is allowed to mind his own business?· 

"No, it's not!• the tulku's father replied. He was quite obstinate, the kind of 
person who only becomes more inflexible the more you oppose him. At this point 
!remembered what Sabchu had once told me about being skillful in discussing 
things with his brother and not opposing him directly.

49. 
The inner retreat 
room at Lachab 

I thought to myself, "He won't be persuaded if I remain so firm. I should try a 
gentle approach. Since he is the father of the Ngaktrin tulku, there is no benefit in 
starting an argument~ 

So I agreed to move my retreat to Lachab and the governor moved his son up 
to Fortress Peak. Lachab was a large monastery, so I didn't feel that it really mat-
tered that much. I entrusted the young tulku to my aunt's care at the hermitage, 
closed off my quarters and didn't allow any visits, not even from benefactors. In 
this way, I avoided a fight with the governor. So my retreat proceeded in peace and 
quiet-but also with a more acute sense of trust in the clairvoyant abilities of the 

Karmapa.12' 
One could call the tulku's father strong-willed and steadfast, but one could also 

say he was rigid and inflexible. It was like trying to move a boulder with a silk 
string. This opposition to my wish to go into retreat in the mountains contrib-
uted to a weariness that welled up within me. These feelings, combined with the 
Karmapa's command to return to Central Tibet and the impending threat from 

the communists in the East, led me to 
make up my mind that my time in Kham 
in this life was drawing to a close. 

Earlier on, I had wished to remain in ri 
treat at Fortress Peak for my entire life; but 
everything, both external and in my own 
heart, began to conspire against it. 

During my retreat, the Dalai Lama, Panchen Lama, Chung Rinpoche 'of 
Mindrolling and the Karmapa all went to Beijing at the request of Mao Tse-
tung. They traveled separately, visiting a variety of places along the way. The pre-
text of the invitation was to honor these masters and show off the wonders of 
Communism, but the real reason was to force the Dalai Lama to publicly a~: 
knowledge that Tibet was an integral part of China.2n Upon their return, I went 
to Chamdo to meet the Karmapa. 

"In the eighth month of this year"-it was now 1955-"you must come to 
Central Tibet," the Karmapa declared. This was not merely a wish; it was a direct 
order. 

"You have to put that in writing. Otherwise, my monastery will never let me 
go. The people back home are very simple-minded and they will prevent me from 
leaving." 

Not only did he give me a letter with his explicit wish, but, as I wasn't.very 



mlthy, from his herd in a 
nearby valley he gave me two 
h.Jrses and four yaks to carry 
iny supplies and belongings. 
This gift was not usual for the 
Karmapa but a sign of his af-
ftction for me. In this way, he 
made sure that I would come 
' 
toTsurphu. 

At Tsurphu with the Karmapa 

1 hadn't seen Uncle Tersey for quite some time. As I had developed a physical 
weakness that prevented me from traveling during the winter, I wanted to visit him 
during the summer. So I asked the Karmapa how long Uncle Tersey had to live. 

After a while, the Karmapa said, "Well, well. I can't say for sure. But let's make 
him stick around for another year.· He said it as if we had control over such things. 

'\'fiSh-Fulfilling Jewel, his life can't be so short! Isn't there any way to extend it?" 
,'] don't know; he replied. "But let's make sure we have him stay around for an-

other year.· As I walked out, I wondered what he could have meant. 

After this, I made the journey from Chamdo to Tsikey monastery to see Uncle 
Tersey. I told him about the Karmapa having ordered me to go to Tsurphu and 
~ut his premonition that the local people at my monastery back home would 
certainly object and cause trouble. I asked for his advice. 

'lfl hear that you went into retreat; Uncle Tersey replied, "or that you are rid-
ing around collecting offerings given in good faith-but have gone against the 
Karmapa's wishes-I will be deeply disappointed. Here's a good excuse for you to 
"use: from Chokgyur Lingpa's time until today, our lineage has never gone against 
.the Karma pas, nor should you. If you find it in yourself to be the first to go against 
·the Karrnapa's word, I will lose every good feeling I have for you~ 

How could anyone be clearer? 
'On the other hand," he continued, "if I hear that while obeying the Karmapa's 

:wish you got killed on the desolate northern plains by a gang of bandits preying on 
tiavelers on the way to Lhasa, I won't feel the slightest remorse. Just do what the 
Karmapa says and I will never worry about you-that is my heartfelt advice!" 

So that sealed my decision to go to Tsurphu, come what may.

A tulku named

Brilliant Moon 

It was at this meeting that Uncle Tersey told me about his time with a tulku named 
Rabsel Dawa, Brilliant Moon. "Old Khyentse was amazing and there's no doubt 
that, as people said, he was the return of Longchenpa in the flesh. But as far as I'm 
concerned, the Khyentse of our time is this tall young tulku, Rabsel Dawa. I feel 
that he will become a replica of the great Khyentse, just like Dzongsar Khyentse.I 
trust that Dzongsar Khyentse has outstanding qualities, both in learning and in re· 
alization, and his activity to influence beings is beyond compare- but what good 
is that to me? Every time I go to Derge I find out he is somewhere else. Four times 
it's happened! I longed to meet him, but now instead I have unexpectedly met this 
tulku from the Dilgo family, who is definitely a sublime being. Honestly, he can 
even read the yellow parchment with the secret script of the dakinis~ 

I myself fully rejoice at having met this Khyentse incarnation, whose great-
ness really doesn't require my adding anything. Today, we know him as Dilgo 
Khyentse. Loter Wangpo", was the first to recognize him as a reincarnation of 

the great Khyentse. He predicted that an ema: 
nation of Old Khyentse had been born as a son 
of the Dilgo family in the district of Denkhog. 
Dzongsar Khyentse also confirmed that this son 
of the Dilgo family was an authentic tulku of 
the great Khyentse and placed him on a throne. 
Then, after he was recognized and enthroned by 
D;r.ongsar Khyentse, whom he regarded as his 
root guru, the Karmapa also verified him as an 
authentic incarnation.

Later the tulku was brought to Shechen mon-
astery where he entered the great Dharma col-
lege ... 4 Seen from the viewpoint of ordinary peo-



pie, he had reached preeminence in education 
due to his outstanding intelligence and diligence. 
But in actuality, he was an emanation of both 
\r~malamitra and the great Khyentse- so what 
dol need to add? Such a precious master! 

He came to be the guru not of just one or 
two people but the entire world. Like the sun 
rising in the sky, his deeds and activity reached 
e\'erywhere. His eyes were so dear, his tongue 
so eloquent! His virtues were truly extraor-
dinary! If you ever met him, you would know 
what I mean. 

Wherever he went there would be a commo-
tion. On first seeing him I heard some Nepali 

Brilliant i\rfoon 

people exclaim, "Padmasambhava must have looked like that! He's so big!" 
When Dzongsar Khyentse departed to the invisible realms, Dilgo Khyentse ap-

peared and continued to shine like the sun for the Buddha's teachings and all be-
bgs. This is the special quality of the Khyentse incarnations: when one of them 
passes away another tulku appears to work for the Dharma in an even greater way. 
In our present time no one equals Dilgo Khyentse in spreading the teachings of 
Khyentse, Kongtrul and Chokling. 

. After Konchok Paldron had passed away, her special possessions were given 
to family members. I received a yellow parchment that was written in the coded 
language of the dakinis. Afraid I might lose it, I entrusted it to Uncle Tersey's safe 
hands. Only realized beings who are treasure revealers can decipher this secret 
lmguage. Rabsel Dawa was such an individual. 

Uncle Tersey had met Rabsel Dawa on several occasions, including once at 
the hermitage above Tsikey. On that visit, Uncle Tersey showed him that small 
'piece of yellow parchment with dakini script. Unfortunately the great mas-
ter Chokgyur Lingpa had never decoded it himself, but he had told Konchok 
Paldron that it contained a lot of teachings. Uncle Tersey told me what then 
_happened. 

'People say that you can read sign script~ he told Rabsel Dawa. "I don't have this 
lhility myself. Is this true- can you really decode the script of the dakinis?" 

The Khyentse tulku replied, "It depends. Sometimes I can, sometimes I can't. 
There's no guarantee:'

Uncle Tersey showed him the piece of parchment from Chokgyur Lingpa, tell-
ing him it supposedly contained a terma that the great terton never succeeded in 
writing down, and asked if he would be willing to give it a try. 

Oil go Khyentse replied, "Since you are a descendant of Chokgyur Lingpa, we 
could try working together to perform the sadhana of Padmasattva-Chokgyur 
Lingpa's pure form-and then see what happens. us We should do it together in 
the shrine room where the body of the great treasure revealer is enshrined. u6 Let's 
wait a couple days and go there on the tenth day of the lunar month;" 

Uncle Tersey had been staying at the retreat center above Tsikey known as 
Mindrolling, the Sanctuary of Ripening and Liberation. The path down to the 
monastery was very steep and quite hazardous; Tersey, quite old by now, was es-
corted down on the early morning of the tenth day. Just the two of them, sit-
ting together, performed the sadhana with a lavish feast offering. This is a unique 
sadhana that had been revealed by the great Khyentse as a mind treasure after 
Chokgyur Lingpa passed away. To allow them to concentrate on the dakini script 
undisturbed, at some point Tersey went and locked the main door so that no one 
could enter. 

"The yellow parchment needs to be soaked in amrita made of the five nectars,• 
Dilgo Khyentse then said. "Dissolve some sacred mendrub medicine in barley 
wine, then place the parchment on top of it;" 

Interestingly, terma paper does not react to liquids in the same way normal 
paper does. It never gets damaged. 

They then began the sadhana in front of the golden stupa and continued all the 
way to the recitations, which took about an hour. At that point, Dilgo Khyentse 
asked for the amrita vessel containing the parchment to be brought over to him. 

"Do you see anything?" Tersey asked. 
"Not a thing;" 
So they continued the practice. In particular, they repeatedly sang the blessed 

. supplication, a prayer to the pure form of the great terton. 
After a while, Dilgo Khyentse said, "Let's take another look;" As they removed 

the lid, he exclaimed, "Now I can see! Bring over some paper to write on;" 
Tersey thought to himself, "There is a correlation between the decoding and 

auspicious coincidence. One should make sure to avoid any extreme-in this 
case, neither too much paper nor too little. I wonder how much paper I should 
get;" 

He went to the cupboard and found some blank sheets of handmade paper with 
dimensions the same as a parchment Chokgyur Lingpa had once found as a terma. 
He took forty sheets and went back to his seat. . 



Brilliant Moon 283 

Dilgo Khyentse took the sheets, noting, •This is going to take a while~ then 
)egan to write rapidly. They kept the door locked the whole time; the attendant 
.-asn't even able to deliver their lunch. By five o'clock, all forty sheets were filled. 

Uncle Tersey told me that from ten until five, the sign script of the dakinis had 
:ransformed itself before Dilgo Khyentse's eyes and he had simply copied down 
.-hat he saw, ·completing the last words of the last sentence on the last piece of 
1aper. 

When Dilgo Khyentse was done writing, he told Uncle Tersey, •It appears you 
!:lUSt be the primary recipient of this teaching, since you are the reincarnation 
of the terton's son. I have merely acted as his assistant. Chokgyur Lingpa's terma 
~chment is authentic and in my vision I received his complete blessings for this 
task. This terma has three levels of detail: extensive, medium and condensed. If I 
had written down the extensive version, it would have filled a large volume, which 
~ more than needed these days. I wrote down the medium version, complete as 
it is. Now the time is up and the script is no longer visible. So let's complete the 
sadhana.• 

With that, they continued with the feast offering and concluded with the dedi-
cation of merit. Then Tersey requested Dilgo Khyentse to give him the empower-
menL ·Now that you have decoded the script, it should be put to use for the ben-
efit of the Dharma and all sentient beings. So, please give me the empowerment 
for it right now:' 

Dilgo Khyentse replied, •1 will surely do so, don't worry. But first we need to 
have it verified by my guru, Dzongsar Khyentse, who is the lord of the Dharma in 
our age. Even though I have no doubt about the authenticity of the parchment, I 
am not fully confident in my ability to decode it. So first let me show it to him. If 
he confirms that it is a true Dharma teaching and gives his consent for propagat-
ing it, then I will certainly come back and offer you the empowerment and reading 
transmission. Otherwise, it is not enough just to have decoded a terma, as I cannot 
justify authenticating it on my own:' 

Uncle Tersey went back up to his retreat center and that evening he slow-
. ly read through the text. It contained a sadhana for the eight consorts of the 
eight herukas in the Eight Sadhana Teachings. There exist many versions of the 
sadhana with the male herukas, but this terma was unusual in being based upon 
their consorts. 

The scripture Dilgo Khyentse wrote down began with a root tantra, resembling 
a short version of the Guhyagarbha Tantra, of astounding beauty and clarity yet 



284 CENTRAL TIBET 

containing in full the ten main aspects of tantra. This tantra was followed by a 
sadhana, then the empowerment ritual, both the general and supt!rior levels. Each 
of these levels had an explanation whose profundity amazed my uncle. 

This is how Chokgyur Lingpa's terma on the eight consorts was established in 
written form. Uncle Tersey later told me, "There is no question that Oil go Khyentse 
knows the symbolic script! I haven't the slightest doubt about it.• 

Dilgo Khyentse took the text with him to show Dzongsar Khyentse, but he 
never got the opportunity to give this empowerment to Uncle Tersey. 

However, this story gives us a glimpse of Dilgo Khyentse's capacity. Wasn't he 
just amazing! He was unique, truly incredible, a master in the truest sense of the 
word. 

Dilgo Khyentse once told me that he had asked Uncle Tersey to give him the 
empowerment for a mind treasure containing dakini teachings.:u7 This empower-
ment had great meaning to him, since it had been revealed by the great Khyentse 
and Tersey had received it straight from him. 

Since Tersey had a direct lineage from the mind treasure's very revealer, 
}amyang Khyentse Wangpo, he replied, "There is no one between me and the great 
Khyentse; I got this from him directly. And isn't it true that you are his reincar-
nation? I'm nothing special, but I can offer you this teaching. since I see we have 
the karma of being linked as master and disciple~ He then proceeded to give the 
empowerment. 

Uncle Tersey had gotten this empowerment when he was quite young and 
went with his mother and his grandmother, Lady Degah, to see Old Khyentse. 
He remembered how "the great Khyentse personally came all the way out into 
the courtyard holding incense and a scarf in the traditional gesture of wel-
come, looking very impressive and tall. He had deep appreciation, not only for 
the terton but for his entire family and treated us all with great respect and 
affection.· 

When Tersey was finished, he said, "I do not have any extraordinary quali-
ties concerning the view, meditation and conduct. But from the beginning of the 
empowerment ritual until this moment, I have maintained the vivid presence of 
being Jamyang Khyentse Wan gpo myself, without a single moment of distraction. 
So, there might be a tiny bit of blessing from this empowerment~ 

Even this low-key claim was very much out of character for Uncle Tersey, who 
never spoke of his abilities in any way. 



Brilliant Moon 285 

Before my return to Nangchen I spent three days together with Uncle Tersey 
at the retreat center above Tsikey. We slept in the same room, ate meals together 
and talked a lot. He gave me some presents including a remarkable little statue of 
!he Lotus-Born master made of a precious mixture of bronze. He had used this 
small kutsab statue during an empowerment that he most graciously bestowed 
upon me. 

I didn't receive that many transmissions from him, but the ones I did get were 
amazing. I was also hesitant to ask him for any empowerment, because I knew 
how meticulous he was and how long it would take, especially if you asked for a 
whole series of transmissions. So I never dared to request more than a few em-
powerments. On meditation practice, however, I received a good deal of instruc-
tion during my last meeting with him. 

Upon giving me the statue he said, •It seems to me the time has come when 
the future transmission of Chokgyur Lingpa's teachings will rest primarily on your 
shoulders. So when the opportunity arises for you to pass them on, please do so. 
I have heard that you are still pretty open-minded and make no real distinctions 
between all the various termas revealed by past tertons, such as the practice of the 
peaceful and wrathful deities revealed by Karma Lingpa, the dakini practices and 
so forth. But don't you see that we already have them all in the New Treasures? 
Since you're the great-grandson of Chokgyur Lingpa, it would be better if you 
practiced our own terma teachings." 
· Basically he was somewhat annoyed that I practiced all these different sadha-
nas, but his displeasure was more an expression of wanting me to appreciate our 
own heritage. I had been particularly fond of a terma by Yongey Mingyur Dorje 
for a longevity practice, as well as a practice of the peaceful and wrathful deities by 
Karma Lingpa. Both were quite popular where I was from.221 

I had often done these practices in the homes of benefactors, and this fact must 
have weighed on his mind, because he insisted, ·You sit in the east with the tormas 
in the west. You sit as you should, but you don't chant what you should. Of course, 
past termas still have great blessings-I'm not denying that. But by using them 
instead of the New Treasures, you are casting away our own tradition. Mark my 
words when I say that this is a great mistake." 

His advice struck my heart like a knife, because what he said was true. He put 
a fright in me that lasted a long time. The rest of my stay, though, he was very af-
fectionate toward me. 

On the third day we walked down to the main monastery at Tsikey. Two days 
bter, when I asked to take leave, he firmly declared, •you and I will never see each 
other again. You will go to Lhasa and spend many years in Central Tibet; I feel 



286 CENTRAL TIBET 

certain the Karmapa won't let you leave there so easily. Even if he did, it seems you 
aren't burning to come back here. I myself am old now and, thanks to the gung-
treng• -the communists-·bad times are headed our way. You will find there is no 
point in wanting to return to Nangchen. 

·oon't plan to see me again. I don't plan on seeing you either. In these bod-
ies we have now, I don't expect we'll ever meet again. But I pray we will do so in 
Chokgyur Lingpa's pure land, the Lotus-Covered Realm. 

·oon't you agree?" he added, jokingly. •This is the Vajrayana tradition-wher-
ever the guru goes, the disciples go too, to assemble in a single mandala. So, since 
Chokgyur Lingpa manifested a pure realm, we should all form the wish to go there." 

With canes in his hands to support his large, magnificent frame, he walked 
with me all the way through the main gate-something quite unusual for him. 
We walked together slowly to a little pass almost a mile away. There he remained 
standing with palms joined, watching me walk away, and uttering good wishes and 
prayers for my protection. 

That was the last time I ever saw him. 

From Tsikey I rode back to Lachab but didn't stay for long. If Uncle Tersey 
hadn't told me I had to follow the Karmapa's command and go to Tsurphu, I would 
have been obligated to remain in my monastery a few months longer. The seaso~ 
for visiting benefactors' homes was upon us and I would surely have collected gen-
erous offerings for Lachab. However, as soon as winter set in I would have been 
stuck, because my physical ailment prevented me from tolerating the outdoors in 
the winter. 

Instead I followed a very tight schedule, arranging to visit four or five benefac~ 
tors daily over just nineteen days. I drastically shortened every ritual, whether for 
the longevity of the living or for the benefit of a recently deceased relative. All the 
money and yaks that I received I left behind for the care of Samten Gyatso's rein-
carnation at Lachab. For myself, I took along little more than the animals that the 
Karmapa had given me. 

Understandably, the immediate reaction to my plans at Lachab was that there 

was no way in the world I could leave. Everyone connected to the monastery 
shared tlle sentiment that their tulku shouldn't go anywhere but stay right there.1 

However, taking Uncle Tersey's advice to heart, my response was, •you must 
be very important, since you want to go against the explicit wish of the Karmapa, 
whose title is Lord of Conquerors! So please, whoever opposes him, each of you 
raise a hand to show that you individually want to break the Karmapa's command 



Brilliant Moon 287 

end stop my departure. I would like to see who you are, so I can write a letter to 
the Karmapa mentioning you by name as the ones who are preventing me and 
~>ho pay no heed to his wishes. As soon as I have written this letter, I will send it 
by messenger to him on a fast horse and stay put right here!· 

All of a sudden everyone seemed to have changed their minds, pleading, ·oon't 
talk like that! If you must go, you must go:" 

It seems that my karmic nemesis, the governor who had tried to prevent my 
t1ree-year retreat at Fortress Peak, had to show up one final time to create ob-
stacles. For some reason, he thought he could rebuke me whenever he felt like 
it-not that I was at all afraid of him. 

"I hear you are about to leave once again: he said. ·That is definitely inappro-
priate. Samten Gyatso's tulku is, of course, the main lama, but he is still a child, 
while you are an adult. It is your responsibility to make sure that offerings keep 
coming in. You do agree that people need to eat, don't you? You may want to play 
and frolic your way through life, but it is neither responsible nor appropriate at 
this time~ 

"Very well. Do you mean to say that I should go against the Gyalwang Karmapa's 
command?• I retorted, using the Karmapa's special title, King of All the Buddhas. 
'Are you in a position to override him? If you are, perhaps I should listen to you 
instead~ 

"Don't use the Karmapa as an excuse: he retorted. ·or course I'm not person-
ally going against his word. But you are not leaving!• 

He was the kind of person who would speak impulsively as if he were in charge. 
So using similar tactics, I snapped, •1 would rather be dead than disobey the 
Karmapa-so I am leaving!• 

After this battle of wills, he just kept quiet, went home and didn't interfere any 
longer. No one else opposed my leaving and I began preparing for my departure. 

You probably have no idea how stubborn Khampas can be, but let me tell you, 
unless you can yield on a small point, you could be heading for a major dispute. 
However, the Karmapa is the one person whom Khampas universally respect; oth-
erwise I might never have gotten out of Kham. 

So in the end, it was the Karmapa who helped deliver me from that particular 
form of samsara known as monastery management. 

Thanks to the Karmapa's letter, I was able to escape to Central Tibet in mid-
summer, the sixth Tibetan month. I left there feeling like someone who has been 
released from a dark dungeon. At that time of year, the rivers swell with summer 



288 CENTRAL TIBET 

rain, so you don't find a single soul traveling the road to Central Tibet. But I had 
no choice if I was to reach Tsurphu by the eighth month. 

Shortly before leaving, I went to spend some time with my brother Penjik. 
"Do you have a firearm you could lend mer 
"Well, well, a gun!" he said, "I have one I can give you." 
"Don't give it to me; I just want to borrow it. I'll bring it back; I promised 
He brought out a Tibetan-made rifle that was practically useless and he also 

forced a precious dagger on me, a family heirloom. I rode off soon after. 
Normally, Khampas travel in large caravans, but since no one makes such a 

journey that late in the summer, there were only the fourteen of us in our party. I 
was probably around thirty-five and my two sons were still toddlers. They sat in 
boxes hanging from the sides of one of the horses. 

The area we were traveling through was notorious for holdups. Several times 
we had to stop and wait when we heard that other travelers had been attacked. 

One day we had stopped for tea along the way, when suddenly four bandits 
on horseback rode up to us. Two were mere teenagers, but the adults looked 
pretty tough. They were dressed in sheepskin coats and had rifles slung over 
their shoulders. My attendant had packed my things In a rush, pulling the rifle 
and knife inside the luggage. Now, when we needed them, they were nowhere 
to be found. 

"Keep your hands up and don't try anything," the leader shouted. "And you over 
there, keep brewing that tea! Bring us some! Looks like you're heading to Tibet 
You must have a bundle of that stuff.' With all their long and short firearms, dag· 
gers and knives pointing here and there, they almost looked like thorn bushes. 

A nun in our company soon walked over with a cup of tea for each of them. 
During all this I had been sitting on a large box in the middle of the camp. My 
hands were tucked inside the shawl I had wrapped around my shoulders and I 
hadn't moved. Slowly I had lifted my index finger and they couldn't tell if I had a 
gun or not. The teenagers were getting antsy and kept fidgeting. 

"Hey, you!" the leader shouted at me. "You're just sitting there-what are you 
thinking aboutr 

I didn't say a word. 
"Which bags have the tea?" the leader demanded. 
"We haven't brought any tea to sell in Lhasa; I said. "There's nothing for_ you 

here:" I still had my finger raised under the shawl. 
"I don't like this; one of the kids said. "Why don't we leave them aloner 
One of my attendants was a true Khampa; he had already grabbed his knife 

inside his jacket. "Keep your hands to yourself.' I whispered to him. 



Brilliant Moon 289 

The tense standoff went on. •This is it!" I thought at one point. •They're going 
to kill the lot of us. Sometimes this kind of thing happens: one intends to practice 
tfte Dharma but winds up getting killed. If my servant pulls out his knife now, what 
good will that do against four men with rifles? I'm not a fighter and I don't intend 
to become one now:' 

All I could think to do was sit there and act as if I had a gun trained on them. 
The youngsters couldn't sit still on their horses; you could see by their faces 

there was no question in their minds I had a gun. 
But not their leader. He simply said, "Look at this guy! He's trying to act tough 

and play games with us. Is that what you're doing? Are you playing with us?" 
I still didn't say a word or make a move. That was good, because even if I'd had 

a gun, I wouldn't have known how to shoot it. Of course, I could have tried using 
a knife, but I wouldn't have stood a chance against those guys. 

The teenagers seemed to have already made up their minds to leave as quickly 
as possible. Something must have made their leader change his mind as well-for 
all of a sudden he grinned and said, "Let's go:' 

The other bandit, who was somewhat older, glanced at me. "He looks like a 
lama. If we kill him, we'll get bad luck:' 

"Hey, you two!" the leader yelled to the young bandits. "Let's not hang around in 
this wretched valley!" One of the teenagers gave a whoop and off they went. 

Two of the nuns were petrified and couldn't walk any further. It was a while 
before any of us dared to laugh. 

Had we brought along some tea or other items to trade in Lhasa, we probably 
could have avoided trouble by handing it over. But who knows? Down the road, we 
ran into other travelers who told us that they had been robbed by the same four 
guys-and one man had even been killed. 

But by the blessings of the Three Jewels, the rest of our journey was safe.

My Last Visit 
to Central Tibet 

Our first stop was Drong monastery, where they wanted to enthrone Cholcyi 
Nyima as the tulku of Gar Drubchen. We stayed there for ten days, then all pro-
ceeded to Drigung and on to Lhasa and Tsurphu. 

On arriving in Central Tibet, I went first to Pawo Rinpoche's monastery at 
Nenang.•" Uncle Tersey had spent a lot of time there, and he and Pawo Rinpoche 
were very close friends. His monastery was near Lhasa on the way to Tsurphu and 
I had some presents for him from Uncle Tersey. He asked me about Tersey and 
how my trip was going. I told him about a new highway from Chamdo to Lhasa 
on which you could travel with motorized vehicles. He was happy to see me and I 
had a delightful stay at his hermitage with its astounding beauty. 

During my stay Pawo Rinpoche once told me, •you should go back to Chamdo 
and invite Tersey Tulku to Central Tibet: I'll put him up here at my hermitage. 
We've always gotten along very well. I have only been able to receive a few of the 
New Treasures from the fifteenth Karmapa, not enough to fully use them to ben· 
efit others. Invite him here so I can get the rest: I'll pay for everything:' 

I was very pleased to hear this and readily agreed, ·Thank you very much; this 
is very kind of you. Because it is you making the invitation, I think he will come. 
Since he is old, he will only be able to come by traveling on the new road:' 

Pawo Rinpoche enthusiastically repeated his invitation adding, ·In the present 
day he is the main holder of the New Treasures:'·. 

Right then and there I promised to do what Pawo Rinpoche had asked. Uncle 
Tersey was not only one of my teachers but also like a second father to me, so of 
course I would see to inviting him. 

But it wasn't so easy. In those days a decision of such importance would first 
have to be presented to the Karmapa for his approval. Besides, Tsikey monastery 
would never let Uncle Tersey travel-as he was their main lama at the time-un-
less it was at the Karmapa's explicit wish. 



My Last Visit to Centra/Tibet 291 

So Pawo Rinpoche decided to get the Karmapa's consent. And I would soon 

have the chance to make the request. 

Just before I arrived at Tsurphu, the Karmapa told a prominent man from 
Nangchen to go down to the road to watch for me. 

"Wouldn't it be better to wait?" the man retorted. "We haven't even received 

word that he has reached Lhasa yet. Besides, it's already getting dark:' 
"Don't worry; the Karmapa reassured him. "Just go and wait. I have a pretty 

strong feeling he's almost here:' 
This turned out to be a good idea, because by the time I arrived dusk was falling 

and it was quite late when we entered Tsurphu; having the guide was helpful. 

Karmapa's attendant was waiting for me and said we were to come right in, so 

!didn't even have time to get the traditional white scarf for greeting or the special 
offerings I had brought for him. Before we had a chance to enter, another servant 
came out who told us that the Karmapa was asking for "the tulku" to come in im-

mediately. 
The servant lent me a scarf as I went in to greet the Karmapa. At the end of our 

conversation, the Karmapa asked me, " Why are you so late- did you stop along 

the way? The road from Lhasa isn't that long!" 
I told him that along the way I had stopped at Nenang to visit Pawo Rinpoche. 

"What were you two talking about that was so important?" the Karmapa asked. 

This was another time my stubbornness surfaced. I told him about Pawo 
Rinpoche's wish to invite Uncle Tersey up to Central Tibet, "How about I catch a 

ride from Lhasa to Cham do, go to Tsikey and bring him back with me? The deci-

sion, of course, is yours- it can only happen with your consent:' 
. "What?!? Forget about it. There's no point; the Karmapa responded. 
What a disappointment! 

"Wtsh-Fulfilling Jewel, how can you say it's point-

less? It's now possible to drive in a motor car. That 

'lr-ay the trip from Cham do to Lhasa takes no more 
than three days. The Pawo tulku will cover all ex-
penses and it will be no inconvenience whatsoever 
to the monastic household in Tsurphu." 
': This wasn't the right thing to say, but it was all I 
could think of at the time. The Karmapa responded, 
"Are you insinuating that I can't feed Tersey Tulku? 
I can feed not just him but twenty of his kind, no

problem! Food isn't the issue. What I mean is that bringing him to Central Tibet 
would be of no use, so you should forget about it!• 

His words saddened me and I wondered what he meant. 
A few days later I had the chance to see the Karmapa again, and this time I 

brought along some presents from Uncle Tersey and tried again. But the Karmapa 
would hear nothing of my hopes to bring Tersey Tulku to Central Tibet. I didn't 
dare mention it again and gave up on the plan for eight or nine days, when I found 
the opportunity to get the Karmapa's attention. 

•Hey, tulku! What are you up to now?· he asked. 
•1 just have a small request, but it's really on my mind. Tersey Tulku has been 

like a father to me, as well as one of my teachers. So I feel I must bring him to 
Central Tibet. Of course, I would remain here as your assistant while he stays at 
Nenang monastery with Pawo Rinpoche. From time to time, he can easily come 
here to offer you any necessary empowerment from the New Treasures, as well as 
perform a ritual for your health. 

•Isn't it true that you have set your mind on receiving the entire New Treasures, 
and at present Tersey Tulku is not only the main lineage holder but also the most 
learned and accomplished master of the lineage? Chokgyur Lingpa is gone and his 
two tulkus are gone as well; so in this lineage there is only Tersey Tulku left. You 
must invite him~ 

What I didn't say was that Uncle Tersey was in Kham, and the way things were 
going there with the communists, I wanted to get him out. 

•Huh! I know he's a good lama. I met him when I visited Tsikey. But isn't it 
enough to tell you twice? By the Three Jewels, don't invite him! It's useless~ 

But I could be very persistent. Two or three days later, as we were engaged in 
some pleasant conversation, I found a moment to bring the matter up one more 
time. 

•By the Three Jewels!• he exclaimed. •It's pointless, it won't amount to anything. 
Don't bring it up again!• 

I had merely displayed how pushy I could be; nonetheless I guess I finally got 
the point. Just to be sure, the Karmapa's attendant carne over and whispered to me, 
·When he speaks like that, it's no use to go on and on asking him. Your Khampa 
tenacity won't help~ That was the last straw, I finally gave up the idea. 

Two months later I got the news that Uncle Tersey had passed away. I recalled 
the Karmapa's earlier remark, •Let's try to make him stick around another year: 
But he hadn't even stayed a full year. 

It would seem that all the while the Karmapa knew Uncle Tersey would soon die. 



Afy Last VISit to Central1ibet 293 

One day at Tsurphu, the Karmapa went down to see the protectors' shrine, a 
separate temple containing a statue of Mahakala, the guardian of the Buddha's 
teachings. This temple is quite dark as it has no windows. By tradition a person's 
name can be placed in a small container for a divination on whether a connection 
\lith them will be helpful, harmful or neutral. 

When the Karmapa goes somewhere, he is rarely alone, so immediately his 
attendants prepared for the walk. There were five or six of us, including the 
Karmapa's general secretary and his chamberlain. 

The Karmapa placed a piece of paper with the question in front of a sacred mask 
that had been crafted many centuries before by a great master-a huge Mahakala 
mask hanging on the wall flanked by Dusolma and another protector. Then he 
returned to his quarters. 

When we went back the next morning, we all saw that something looking like 
blood had begun to flow from the eyes of the mask, especially the left eye. This 
reddish liquid had already filled three bowls up to the brim. 

Something like this had happened once before, many centuries ago, during a 
battle between the Tibetan government and China. That time the •blood· had 
dripped from the curved knife instead of the mask. 

After verifying that the shrine had been locked up for the night, we were sure 
no one had entered. We felt that the dripping liquid was quite ominous. 

The Karmapa just said, •What a pity!• and fell silent. 
For a day or so, he said nothing about the divination. It wasn't until the next 

evening that he spoke. •I think we better go back and take another look. I want to 
know how much blood has flowed from the left eye.• 

This time we saw that the red liquid was flowing from both eyes equally. 
:"What a pity!• the Karmapa repeated. •previously when blood flowed from this 

mask, our government was fighting the foreign power to the east. That time, Tibet 
won the battle and, as a sign of victory, blood dripped from the curved knife. 

"Now it seems that Mahakala is crying tears of blood. The Buddha's teachings 
in Tibet will probably disappear. What a tragedy!• 

At this point, the red liquid had spilled onto the floor-we all saw it. I'm not 
talking about just a few drops.'JO 

Around this time, Dudjom Rinpoche told me he had seen something similar 
to this in the Kongpo district south of Lhasa, when ·blood· flowed for seven days 
straight from a statue of a heruka made by the master Tsele Natsok Rangdrol. He 
said it flowed so much it almost reached the entranceway. 

There was a rule that whenever omens like this occurred, whether auspicious 
or not, a letter describing them should be sent to the government in Lhasa. And

soon a minister replied in writing, "There is no need to worry. At the three large 
monasteries of Sera, Drepung and Ganden the recitation of a particular form of 
wrathful Manjushri will be repeated six million times. This will ensure that the 
threat will be eliminated:' 

This was the only response that was offered, even though the omen foretold the 
destruction of Buddhism in Tibet. 

It is amazing how a country like Tibet could have the merit to host so many 
great masters and at the same time lose everything. 

The Karmapa was about to leave on a pilgrimage to India and we parted 
ways. That gave me the chance to visit the famous sacred place Drak Yerpa 
near Lhasa, where I stayed in a cozy little cave that opens into the Moon Cave. 
I must admit, however, this was not a time of true solitude, for I had brought 
along my two children, their mother, an old nun related to my mother and two 

attendants. 
One night I had a dream. It seemed that I had awoken inside a cave and some-

where close-by there was a dakini of incredible beauty, captivating to behold and 
wearing exquisite jewelry. During the dream I somehow knew that it was a dream 
and that I was actually still in the Moon Cave. The thought that this beauty must 
be a wisdom dakini gave rise to strong feeling of devotion. At first she stood still; 
then she began a graceful dance with swift movements. 

At one point I asked her, "Our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, the Karmapa, has gone on 
a pilgrimage to India. I hear that the king of Bhutan may invite him there as well 
Is this true?" 

"He has been invited, but it is not an insistent request and the Karmapa will not 
go to Bhutan; she replied. "The king will instead send offerings:' 

"What will happen to Tibet?" I asked. "Will the Chinese invade or not? We hear 
over the new telephone line from the east that people are getting killed there:' 



My Last Visit to Centra/Tibet 295 

"The Chinese will come:' 

"When?" 

"Thirty-six months from now the Buddha's teachings in Tibet will be stamped 
to the ground and the land left in darkness:''' ' 

·wm the Dalai Lama go into exile? Some people say he will stay:' 
"He will leave. There is no doubt. He will go to India:' 
I el)ded the conversation by asking a simple question about the Dalai Lama's 

whereabouts in the near future, so that I could verify the accuracy of her other 

statements. 
She was so pretty l didn't want to wake up, thinking that opening my eyes would 

cause her to vanish. But awash with hope and fear, I eventually opened them any-
way, expecting to wake up in my normal surroundings, and was surprised to see 
thedakini still visible at a slight distance. I was actually quite fascinated by her, she 

was so beautiful, but as I gazed at her, she slowly disappeared. 
Since my big mouth won't stay closed, upon returning to Lhasa I had to tell 

someone about the dream. So I told Dudjom Rinpoche that I had had an unusual 
dream. Then I asked whether the Karmapa had gone to Bhutan. 

"The king sent an invitation with offerings; he replied, "but our Wish-Fulfilling 
Jewel didn't go:' 

I then continued to relate my dream and what the dakini had said. By this time, 
my question about the Dalai Lama's whereabouts had also been confirmed. 

'Oh my!" exclaimed Dudjom Rinpoche, "I believe you have received a prophecy 
about the future of Tibet." Then he muttered, "Oh my" a few more times before 

adding, "We must prepare for the worst:' 
Not long after, being the blabbermouth that I am, I shared my dream with both 

the Karmapa and Dzongsar Khyentse, who replied, 

'That is definitely bad news:' 
I'm not the type who usually has lucid dreams, but 

this one has stayed in my memory as clear as when 
:it happened. It was too vivid to forget- its message 
haunted me day and night. 

When I returned to Kham the last time, I real-
ized how the political situation had taken a turn for 
the worse. Even then I saw what was soon to befall 
.Tibet. From whatever angle I looked at things, it was 
obvious that Tibet would lose its independence. I felt 

56. 
The young

Rinpoche

certain-a sentiment that no one around me seemed to share. 
If 1 raised the topic in Kham, people would make a contemptuous sound and 

refuse to even consider it. If I mentioned it in Central Tibet, it seemed no one lost 
any sleep worrying that the end of the Dharma was fast approaching. 

But 1 had no peace. ·what's going to happen to Tibet?• 1 would worry. ·When 
the flood of communists sweeps in from the east, how can a bundle of grass and 
a few twigs restrain it? The whole of Tibet will be inundated. The Khampas look 
to the Central Tibetan government for support, but who will be the final support? 
The Tibetan government has no one to turn to. I am sure this will not end well~ 

Th~se were the thoughts I agonized over. 
Isn't it a fact that everything comes to an end? The Chinese army numbered in the 

hundreds of thousands, while I doubt there were more than ten thousand Tibetan 
soldiers in the entire country. How could such a small force turn back an invasion? 

The Central Tibetans were shrewder than the Khampas, but what good would 
that do them? This shrewdness had caused them to postpone making any solid a]. 
liances because of a belief in their independent strength. Now it seemed obvious 
there wasn't a single other country that would come to the aid of Tibet in a time 
of trouble. Meanwhile, the nobility and government officials busied themselves 
living off whatever they could extort from the common people, never using the 
funds for anything useful, let alone what they were intended for. How could that 
possibly end well? 

Most people in Kham were not what you would call politically astute. They 
would simply repeat empty platitudes like ·The snowy ranges of Tibet are like a 
beautiful painted scroll with Lhasa in the center. How could the communists ever 
damage that! 

Though such foolish beliefs were quite popular, how can I fault them? They 
didn't know any better. Still, this is the same as saying, •I won't die because I haven't 
experienced it:' 

I'm not sure where the Khampas got the idea that the government in Lhasa 
could protect them against the Red Army and that powerful India was standing 
behind Tibet ready to help. To top it off, they believed that the rest of the world, 
including the United States, was just waiting to come to Tibet's assistance-all 
they had to do was send the word. 

I am not making this up. Many Khampas actually believed it. Why don't we just 
call it wishful thinking?

Amazing Masters in Lhasa 

DZONGSAR KHYENTSE 

~'hUe in Lhasa I was able to spend time with a wonderful master, the beloved 

[)zongsar Khyentse. In Kham this tulku became as famous as the great Khyentse 
hmself; he was not just a tulku of the first Khyentse but a near replica. He was 
hrned, noble and accomplished, and had an amazing presence. 

In the latter part of his life, he fell seriously ill and remained so for three years, 
•ith no cure in sight. Finally he was requested to accept a consort to improve his 
health. He replied, •If there is no way around it, I will give back my monastic vows~ 

He then went on to describe a particular young woman and her whereabouts. 

She and her family were sent a letter of invitation, and she came to live with him!'' 

~o longer a monk, Dzongsar Khyentse now became a ngakpa- and a perfect one 

at that. 
When the political situation in Kham became untenable, he used the pretext 

of a short trip to leave for Central Tibet without 
letting anybody know. That way no one was able 
to stop him. He passed through Nangchen on the 

way. 
As I mentioned, Dzongsar Khyentse had earlier 

1isited Fortress Peak, Samten Gyatso's mountain 

hermitage. There Dzongsar Khyentse requested 

my guru to give him the transmissions for the 
sections of the New Treasures composed by the 
fifteenth Karmapa that he had not received. But I 
did not meet him then.

statue of Buddha Shakyamuni at the Jokhang in

Lhasa, word went around that Dzongsar Khyentse was arriving. He came striding 
in with immense presence, wearing the Lotus-Born master's famous lotus crown 
and Dharma robcs.ns 

All around people were whispering, "Look there! Who is that? Looks like a 
great master. He's dressed like Padmasambhava~ Almost instantly he became re-
nowned all over Lhasa. While he was staying at the house of an important digni-
tary, I went to visit him; he was transmitting the Four Branches of Heart Essence, a 
most important set of Dzogchen teachings. 

"Who are you?" he asked. 
"I am a Khampa,· I replied. 
"From where in Kham?" 
"I am from Chokgyur Lingpa's family. I am his great-grandson~ 
"Neten Chokling has no children~ Dzongsar Khyentse was very close to the 

Chokling of Neten. He continued, "So whose son are you?" 
"Neten Chokling is the reincarnation, but I am the descendant of Chokgyur 

Lingpa himself, since my father was born from his daughter~ 
"Ohhhh ... so maybe you're the one who's the descendant of Chokgyur Lingpa 

that everyone is talking about-the one who is giving the Three Sections empower-
ments to Karmapa Rigpey Dorje! Is that your 

What could I say other than "Yes, that's me"? I guessed this meant that we had 
now been formally introduced. 

"Well, well, if that's the case, then you must arrange for me to meet the Karmapa; 
he said. "He holds the lineage for an empowerment that enables the disciple to 
master the display of awareness .• ,. I must receive it from Rigpey Dorje in person. 
Please assist me by asking him on my behalf.' 

To help facilitate such an auspicious meeting, I first took the Karmapa's general 
secretary and several members of the Karmapa's family to see Dzongsar Khyentse. 
This meeting went well, and soon Dzongsar Khyentse was invited to Tsurphu to 
give teachings and empowerments. I remember clearly that Dzongsar Khyentse 
arrived on the twenty-third and remained at Tsurphu until the eighth day of the 
following month. 

Our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel treated Dzongsar Khyentse with great respect, put-
ting him up in some of the best quarters. I was fortunate enough to receive the 
empowerments from them both and could see with my own eyes how fond they 
had become of each other. Dzongsar Khyentse stayed at Tsurphu during the New 
Year's celebrations, where he was treated with great honor and placed on the lofty 
Dharma throne. 



Amazing Masters in Lhasa 299 

In private the Karmapa told me, •1 am deeply thrilled that we could host 
WI a great master. Even though these times are troubled, he puts me totally at 

• liSe. 
The Karmapa requested a mind treasure of the first Khyentse concerning 

v..vulali, the Mother of Longevity in a form that had a seal of secrecy. ass In turn 
~.ongsar Khyentse requested the empowerment of the red form of Avalokiteshvara 
bown as Ocean of Conquerors, the single most important yidam of all the . 
Imnapas since the time of Karma Pakshi, the second Karmapa. Connected to 
·tis empowerment there is a particular aspect known as ·the empowerment for 
t.e play of awareness• that the Karmapa also gave him.''' Only Ponlop Rinpoche, 

1 t~o was the Karmapa's brother, and I were allowed inside the inner chamber dur-
i;gthese empowerments. . 

After the transmissions, the conversation turned to the future of Tibet. 
Dzongsar Khyentse said, •It seems obvious to me that the communists are up 
:ono good. My main reason for coming here was actually to ask you personally 
~-hat you see about me going to Pemako,• a very remote· mountain region on the 
l:idian border. 

After a short while the Karmapa said, ·Pemako, Pemako ••. It doesn't look good. 
The mountains are very steep, and the river on the way is difficult to cross-but 
~,the end the communists will invade there as well. That's what I see. Rinpoche, 
)'011 must go to Sikkim!" 

"Very well, Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, I have faith in you as someone who can clearly 
see past, present, and future. I will follow your advice. Eventually I had planned 
on leaving Tibet through the district of Kongpo, but I had my doubts. That is why 
I came to ask you!" 

During his time at Tsurphu, Dzongsar Khyentse became one of my teachers. 
I got to clarify many important points with him since, for many days in a row, 
some conceited Tsurphu secretaries barred him from meeting the Karmapa. 
This was nothing new; the same thing had happened to many other great lamas 
as well. Also, when he first arrived at Tsurphu, no one seemed to appreciate 
what an extraordinary, great master Dzongsar Khyentse truly was. Other than 
me, not a single person came to request teachings from him. One reason was 
that he was living in the Karmapa's quarters, which were difficult to get access 
to. Another reason was that people close to the Karmapa seemed to lose all ap-
preciation for other lamas; they found it hard to have faith in anyone else. So 
for that period it was my good fortune to have no competition to see Dzongsar 
Khyentse. 



300 CENTRAL TIBET 

But, as the days went by, the Tsurphu Khandro, who had been the consort of 
the previous Karmapa, the Tsurphu vajra master, and 1 were seen going in and out 
getting teachings. Eventually the word got around and soon people were standing 
in line to see him. 

Before leaving Tsurphu, Dzongsar Khyentse asked for eight sets of the medi-
um-length sadhana for Tukdrub Barchey Kunsel, saying, •This is a special terma 
meant specifically for this time. Please ask our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel if 1 may get 
copies of it.• 

Then he asked to borrow a small image that the first Karmapa had consecrated 
by biting into the bronze. These statues had never been seen before in Kham, but 
Dzongsar Khyentse knew that the Karmapa had several. The Karmapa seemed 
quite pleased with this request and, when he had his store of relics searched, he 
found two. 

•1 want to give one to you: he suddenly told Dzongsar Khyentse. 
Dzongsar Khyentse tried to refuse, but the Karmapa forced him to take il 

You should have seen the ripple it created throughout Tsurphu. Every time two 
monks crossed paths, it was the main topic of conversation, •This Sakya lama 
from Dzongsar has gotten one of our most valued treasures-the statue that our 
first Karmapa, Dusum Khyenpa, bit into. lf our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel gives away 
treasures like that, I don't know what will happen to the Dharma! He is giving away 
our very heart!• 

A critical attitude was in the air. 1 tried to stop the monks by telling them. 
•Don't talk like that! The Karmapa is the lord of the Dharma and there must be a 
good reason if he gives away a statue like that. Besides, it is only one of two; the 
other is still here at Tsurphu:' 

•yes, yes, but two is better than one!• came the reply. 
Clearly, the Karmapa did not see it the same way. When Dzongsar Khyentse 

was about to end his stay, the Karmapa commented, •When this old lama leaves 
Tsurphu, the place is going to seem empty:' 

When Dzongsar Khyentse returned again to Lhasa, 1 had the opportunity to 
receive some more teachings from him. ln particular, he gave an instruction from 
the great Mipham to town yogis.237 lt begins this way:

Without the need for lengthy study, thought and meditation, 
But by maintaining mind-essence through pith instruction's way, 
A common town yogi can reach a knowledge-holder's stage with minor 

hardship-
This is the power of the most profound of paths. 

He taught very slowly in the early mornings over several days, and I enjoyed 
Oill' sessions together immensely. We also had the chance to exchange other teach-

. L1gs. For instance, I had some clarifications by Karmey Khenpo on the practice 
of the Lotus Dakini from the Sevenfold Cycle of Profundity I had brought along. 
Dzongsar Khyentse had a copy made and I was happy to offer him the reading 
transmission. 

While in Lhasa I also met Dilgo Khyentse- the other incarnation of the great 
Khyentse. Though I had heard about him and his revelation of the dakini scroll 
!had given to Uncle Tersey, I had never met him. As it happened, Uncle Tersey 
had passed away that very winter; some of his special possessions were to be 
given to Dilgo Khyentse and I was given the task of bringing them to him at 
Samye. 

Dilgo Khyentse was tall and impressive. He told me about his Dharma connec-
·tion to my family through Uncle Tersey and that he would be delighted to give me 
some transmissions. Just then he was on his way to Tsurphu to meet the Karmapa 
and he said that when he came back we would discuss it further. 

I took the occasion to remind him of the story that Uncle Tersey had told me 
about the dakini terma of the Eight Consorts, adding that he had ordered me to 
request the transmission from this Khyentse tulku. 

Dilgo Khyentse replied, -sack in Kham I showed 
the forty pages to Dzongsar Khyentse and he told 
me, 'You must give me that empowerment and the 
reading transmission. I had been aware of one of 
Chokgyur Lingpa's dakini cycles that hadn't been 
put into writing till now and this seems to be that 
very one. You have done an impressive job!' I of-

fered the empowerment and reading of the entire 
cycle to him. 

58. 
Dilgo Khyentse 
Rinpoche in 

-aut as for your request, we are out of luck right 
now, as I left the text with him, so I can't give it 
to you now. You'll have to ask Dzongsar Khyentse 
when you see him; he said he wanted to take charge ~:.....iii-.:......., lhasa 



302 CENTRAL TIBET 

of that teaching~ Still, Dilgo Khyentse seemed quite pleased that I had asked and 
he was very kind to me. 

•It's a magnificent terma; he went on, •but what can I do-l gave it to Dzongsar 
Khyentse and 1 don't have the text. Because of the deteriorating situation in east· 
ern Tibet, I had to escape to Lhasa and had no idea that Dzongsar Khyentse would 
already be here. I expected him to come later. Dzongsar Khyentse told me that he 
sent someone to Kham in order to pick up those texts, but he doesn't know what 
has happened to them~ 

So, some time later, in one of the many wonderful conversations that 1 had 
with Dzongsar Khyentse, I told him Uncle Tersey's story about the terma Dilgo 
Khyentse had transcribed. •Rinpoche; I asked, •he told me you have the text. Did 
you bring it?• 

Dzongsar Khyentse replied, •This was no ordinary terma that tulku wrote down! 
He landed something quite marvelous. It even included a tantra-and, let me tell 
you, not all tertons can manage to do that! The great Khyentse and Kongtrul could, 
and Chokgyur Llngpa received a couple as wdl. .,. 

•1 made Rabsel Dawa give me the transmission and immediately afterward I 
had woodblocks carved for the entire text, with the intent to propagate it. But now 
look what has happened! The enemies of the Buddha's teachings suddenly arose 
from the east and began their invasion. Since I had to leave in such a hurry, there 
was no way I could bring it along. Let me tell you how little I managed to carry 
with me: only the three tiny kutsab statues that Padmasambhava concealed as his 
representatives for the benefit of Tibet..,, That was it! All the other sacred images, 
scriptures and relics-there just wasn't any chance. Our sublime scriptures are 
lost to the enemies of the Dharma!• 

In short, even though Dzongsar Khyentse had secured the transmission, he was 
now unable to pass it on. He lost everything else as well-all the sacred objects 
that represent enlightened body, speech and mind.140 

So when it comes to receiving this terma as Uncle Tersey advised, I feel I have 
tried my best, requesting it first from Uncle Tersey himself, then from Dilgo 
Khyentse and finally from Dzongsar Khyentse. 

One day Dzongsar Khyentse said, ·rm going on a pilgrimage around Central 
Tibet, and if you come along there are some empowerments and reading trans-
missions I can share with you. There are also a few rare pieces from the New 
Treasures that 1 haven't received and I think you have. Don't you think it would be 
nice if we traveled together for a bit? Why don't you ask the Karmapa for permis-
sion to come with mer 



Amazing Masters in Lhasa 303 

It didn't turn out as we had planned though, as the Karmapa wanted very spe-
cific rituals done those days and we were in the middle of performing a ritual of 
aorcism connected to the Lion-Faced Dakini that took nine days. So when I told 
Dzongsar Khyentse that the Karmapa had refused to let me go, he had no choice 
but to leave without me. 

DUDJOM RINPOCHE 

I have already mentioned Dudjom Rinpoche but I 
never explained how we met. 

One day while Dzongsar Khyentse was still in 
Lhasa, I went over to meet him. But I was told at 
the door he would be gone for the rest of the day; he 
had gone to a tent camp on the outskirts of Lhasa 
' 
to ask Dudjom Rinpoche to give him an empow-
erment. When I next saw him, he expressed his 
deep admiration for Dudjom, ·In our present time, 
l don't believe there is any vidyadhara more accom-
plished than Dudjom. That's why I had to request 
an empowerment from him! .. 

Soon after, I met Dudjom Rinpoche myself. He 

was staying at the home of an aristocrat of good 
character whom I knew. Now this dignitary wanted to perform one hundred thou-
sand feast offerings in his household temple and had invited Dudjom Rinpoche to 
preside. Since he knew I was in town, he invited me to come. It was during these 
one hundred thousand feasts that Dudjom and I met, and spent time together. 

"Who are you?" he asked me. 
"I am from Kham; I replied. 
"Where in Kham are you from?'" 
"From Nangchen~ 
"Which lineage do you belong to?" 
"I belong to the Barom Kagyu lineage: 
"What do you practice?" 
"I practice the termas of Chokgyur Lingpa." 
"You might be related to him then~ 
"Yes, in fact, I am one of his great-grandchildren~ 
"Explain your family line~

Chatral Rinpodle 

I told him that I was the son of Chimey Dorje and the nephew of Samten 

Gyatso. 
"Oh reallyr Dudjom replied. "I received parts of the Three Sections of the Great 

Perfection from Samten Gyatso and regard him as one of my root gurus. I recently 
heard about a Khampa lama who gave the Karmapa the Three Sections empower-
ment at Tsurphu-is that you?· 

Obviously, word had gotten around, so I admitted, "Yes, that's me~ 
"Do you have the books with you?" 
"Yes, I do; they are back in my quarters at Tsurphu~ 
"Do you have the icons?· 
"Yes, I have them as well.· 
"Excellent, because you will have to give that teaching to me. I got the first three 

empowerments at Tsurphu, but I definitely want it in full." 
Dudjom Rinpoche was very insistent, so I had to dispatch my attendant to 

Tsurphu immediately to get the books and icons while the Karmapa was away on 
a journey to Sky Lake, northwest of Lhasa. Soon after, I had to offer Dudjom this 
transmission, to the best of my meager abilities. 

A few days into offering these empowerments, I 
met Chatral Rinpoche. His appearance was striking: 
he wore coarse felt garments and had a prominent 
nose and a Khampa bearing. Our conversation began 

like this: 
"You, lama! Where are you from?" he demanded 

brusquely. 
"I am from Nangchen:' 
"From where in Nangchen?" 
"I am a descendant of Chokgyur Lingpa:' 
"I've been to Tsikey and I didn't see you there:' 

"I didn't always stay at Tsikey~ 
"Then where are you from? Out with it!" 
"Chokgyur Lingpa's daughter, Konchok Paldron, had four sons one of whom 

was my father:' 
"Hmmm ... hmmm ... I had heard that you were supposed to be the nephew 

of Neten Chokling. I know him from Dzongsar, where he came to visit Dzongsar 
Khyentse, but I've never heard that he had a lama nephew. Now I hear that our 
Dudjom Rinpoche is receiving the Three Sections from such a nephew, and we all

l.now that plenty of these so-called Khampa lamas come here to Central Tibet to 
try out their various tricks. So, I was wondering if you were just another one of 
them. Hmmm .. :' 

He was staring at me with his big eyes glaring the whole time. ·A lot of Khampa 
lamas come here and cheat people by giving empowerments to which they have 
no lineage;" 

Dudjom Rinpoche, who was sitting right there, broke in and said, •It was I who 
asked him to give this transmission;" 

And soon they began to crack one joke after another, during which Chatral 
Rinpoche turned to me with a smirk and said, ·okay, I guess you are not a fake 
after all-you can go ahead and give him the empowerment then;" 

While I was offering the empowerments to Dudjom Rinpoche, the Chinese 
communists were already in Lhasa. Yet only a few people were aware of their plans 
to take over Tibet. Ta Lama, one of the important ministers at that time, kept a 
fine, dignified face in public, but as soon as we saw him in private, he would ask, 
'Do you have any terma predictions from the Lotus-Born master concerning our 
time?'" 

It seemed that the Tibetan government didn't exactly have the fearless and un-
shakable confidence of mastery, and they were hoping to find a solution to the 
crisis through Padmasambhava's prophecies. In fact, there were several clear ter-
ma prophecies by the Lotus-Born about the imminent destruction of Tibet, some 
even mentioning invasion from the east. 

But people paid no heed, or else they misinterpreted the omens. For instance, 
one text of predictions said that in the future, ·uke a flower amid a lake, the Jowo 
will be worshipped from afar,· which was interpreted to mean that the Jowo statue 
was so precious that it was indestructible. The real meaning was that people would 
be prevented from seeing it or forced to live in exile from Tibet. 

I asked Ta Lama if they had tried to establish diplomatic relations with foreign 
powers like the United States, India and Great Britain. He replied that they had 
but had not received any firm commitments. Meanwhile, the Chinese commu-
nists had only one aim in mind: to devour Tibet. 

This threat weighed on my mind, so much so that I often could not sleep. 
I had a feeling that sooner or later Tibet would be lost and I needed to flee 
somewhere free of communist invaders. It was not in my heart to remain in 
Tibet-not in the least. I am sorry to say so, but a great many Tibetan govern-
ment officials were enticed by the silver coins that the Chinese gave out lavishly, 



306 CENTRAL TIBET 

and so many officials claimed that that there was nothing to worry about-ev· 
erything was just fine. 

One day, Dudjom Rinpoche confided that he felt we still had about one year 
left. ·we should take advantage of the Chinese while we can. I plan to stay 
here for about one year, and to use their silver coins to ensure the Dharma's 
future .• 24' 

·There is no way I will remain that long; I replied. ·rve already asked for the 
Karmapa's permission to leave. I'm going to get out before anybody else.· 

Around this time, a Committee of Religious Affairs was established in Lhasa. 
composed of the heads of the various schools. Meetings of the group were orches· 
trated by the Chinese occupation forces in order to control the Buddhists from 
above. 

Not wishing to attend in person, the Karmapa sent me in his place. I couldn't 
excuse myself because of the Karmapa's wish that I represent him in Lhasa, so I 
had to go. Dudjom Rinpoche represented the Nyingma school. There were also 
representatives of the Sakya, Gelug, and Bonpo-five Dharma traditions in all 

Our main activity at these meetings was to while away the hours as one person 
after another gave lengthy lectures extolling the virtues of Dharma practice-while 
in reality our time for practicing the Dharma was quickly running out. Under the 
pretext of encouraging Dharma lectures to a large audience, the communist lead· 
ers were pulling the wool over everyone's eyes. Each speech had to start out with a 
salute to the ·authentic reign of the great helmsman, Mao Tse-tung; thanking him 
for his ·immense kindness, which has finally allowed the five spiritual traditions to 
assemble under one roo£:'242 

In a typical display of Chinese cunning, at each event the communist officials 
would hand out bags of money, twenty-five large silver coins a day. Even my at· 
tendant, who was a secretary from Tsurphu and a very good man, got fifteen. So 
simply sitting there would earn me twenty-five large silver coins, which was a sig· 
nificant amount in those days. If you could grin and bear it for a month, you could 
collect a considerable sum. 

However, I didn't keep any of those silver coins, feeling in the core of my heart 
no desire to form a concrete link with the communists. Rather than using that 
money even for transportation, I opted to represent all the Kagyu lineages by walk· 
ing everywhere on foot. After twenty-five days,l got a chance to visit Tsurphu, and 
along the way I threw away all the silver coins. 

·w'hy are you here and not at the assembly?• the Karmapa asked. 



Amaziug lvfasters in Lhasa 307 

"I don't want to attend any longer, even if you threaten to chop off my head!" I 

said. 
-"Very well, we'll find someone else; he replied. 
I then told him another tulku had volunteered to take my place and asked if that 

would be acceptable. The Karmapa consented and 1 was off the hook. 
Later, when things got really bad in Lhasa, my replacement failed to escape. 

Even though they had regularly given him silver coins for two or three years, the 
Red Army executed him. . 

SHECHEN l<ONGTRUL 

A.s I was preparing to leave Tibet, a wonderful master named Shechen Kongtrul 
gave me a letter to deliver to Dzongsar Khyentse, who was already in Sikkim. 
Handing me the letter, he said, "These days it is definitely justifiable to say that 
Dzongsar Khyentse is Old Khyentse in person. Nowadays it seems very easy for 
people to meet him down in Gangtok, which is actually quite incredible. Please 
take this letter to him." 

It was extremely unusual for this master to offer such praise about anyone. But 
when I later gave Dzongsar Khyentse the letter, he put it on his head and said, 
'This is from someone who is like Old Kongtrul in person. It may seem as though 
it was very easy for you to meet him, but it is amazing good fortune~ They had this 
remarkable mutual admiration for, and pure perception of, each other. 

Shechen Kongtrul had reached the collapse of delusion. Noble beings at this 
level very often act in a totally spontaneous way, like children, without any sec-
ond thoughts regarding social conventions- and 
that's how Shechen Kongtrul seemed during the 
last years of his life. 

Once, while he was in Lhasa, one of the min-
isters of Central Tibet came to visit him. The of-
ficials of the Lhasa governing body of that time all 
kept their hair tied up on their head, decorated 
with a golden relic box. Yogis often tie their hair 
up too, with a small relic box containing sacred 
scriptures or relics. Even though this man was 
clearly dressed as a Tibetan dignitary, Shechen 
Kongtrul said to him, "Hey, yogi, where are you 
coming from?" 

61. 
The Kongtrul of 
Shechen 



308 CENTRAL TIBET 

•Rinpoche, psstt; someone leaned over to him and whispered, •He's not a yogi. 
he's a minister:" 

·oh, so you're a minister; Shechen Kongtrul blurted. •1 thought you were a 
yogi. Where are you from?· The minister was very embarrassed. 

On another occasion, Ngabo, a high government official, had invited Chung 
Rinpoche of Mindrolling, Shechen Kongtrul, Dilgo Khyentse and many other 
monks to perform a ceremony at the Jokhang. They all sat together. 

Ngabo did not come in person but sent his wife, a woman of high standing who 
was addressed as Lhacham Kusho, Her Ladyship. Because she was a VIP, when 
she gave a white scarf with an envelope of money to Chung Rinpoche, she also 
lowered her head-not as low as an ordinary person would to receive a blessing 
from the lama's hand, but only to the level of touching foreheads. 

At that, Shechen Kongtrul nudged Dilgo Khyentse with an elbow and burst out 
loudly, ·Hey Khyentse, quick! What am I supposed to do with that woman? I've 
never touched heads with one before:" Meanwhile the woman had stepped over 
and was standing right in front of him. 

·Just keep quiet and touch heads!• Dilgo Khyentse whispered. So, Shechen 
Kongtrul bent down and touched heads with her in the manner of greeting be· 
tween equals. 

She then presented him with a scarf accompanied by a traditional envelope 
of money as an offering. While Dilgo Khyentse was seated next to him receiving 
his scarf and offering, Shechen Kongtrul had already torn open his envelope and 
looked inside-breaking every rule of decorum. 

He took out the money and spoke up for all to hear, ·Hey Khyentse, look what 
I got! How much did you getr 

I wasn't there, but Dilgo Khyentse himself told me the story and warned, •It's 
impossible to sit next to him in public:" 

When Shechen Kongtrul spoke about mundane affairs, he could often be quite 
childish, but when he spoke about the Dharma, his wisdom was like the rising sun 
dispelling the darkness. In Lhasa I once had the chance to ask him who he felt were 
the most realized masters in Tibet. 

·Take a look at Dudjom; he replied. •His eyes are so bright and present, almost 
like a hawk. In the eyes you can see the quality of complete open awareness. If 
anyone has realization, he does. Compared to him everyone else seems quite dull 
and absentminded:" 



Amazing Masters in Lltasa 309 

"What about that master Drukpa Yongdzin, who is so greatly renownedr I 
then asked. 

"He's definitely got it too. His mind is wide open, without a shred of ignorance,• 
replied Shechen Kongtrul. •I hear that he doesn't even sleep~ 

Then I asked him what he meant by high realization. 
"It i~ when your awareness is unimpeded and free of fixation, and yet you are 

acutely present and attentive to detail~ 
He then precisely demonstrated just this. I felt sure that he was a highly realized 

master himself and I had deep trust in him. 

There had been an uprising against the Chinese occupation forces in Kham, al-
though Central Tibet was still calm. While I was still at Tsurphu with the Karmapa, 
Shechen Kongtrul stopped there. 

He told me of a premonition, •Whenever I see a Chinese communist these days, 
I immediately get a pain in my chest. I feel extremely uncomfortable. Probably I 
will be taken off by the communists someday~ 

He made this comment several times. Once I asked, •Why would you be taken 
off by the communists? Karmapa is sending you to Sikkim to become the main 
guru of the Sikkimese king. Our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel has already made the ar-
rangements, telling the Sikkimese, 'I'm sending this lama to you to be the guru of 
the court: 

·since you are leaving Tibet so soon; I asked him, •why do you think the 
Chinese will take you?· 

Shechen Kongtrul replied, •z don't know why, but l just feel it will likely happen.• 
Before leaving for Sikkim he wanted to visit different places in Central Tibet. 

But Karmapa told him, ·oon't. You should remain right here. Soon, you must 
leave straight for Sikkim. The main sponsor of Mindrolling is already there. You 
must join him; you will have perfect circumstances there.· 

But Shechen Kongtrul objected, •1 must go to Mindrolling first. Mindrolling is 
like the cornerstone of the Nyingma tradition. l must pay just one visit there~ 

They argued back and forth, until finally the Karmapa said, •All right, if you 
must go, I will make all the arrangements for you and provide the servants. But 
you can stay there no more than two weeks. Then you have to come straight back 
here and go on to Sikkim~ 

Shechen Kongtrul promised to remain not a day longer than two weeks at 
Mindrolling. In accord with the Karmapa's command, he stayed only two weeks, 
then headed back to Tsurphu. 



310 CENTRAL TIBET 

On the way back, he encountered a group of people at the crossing of a large 
river. It. just so happened that they were members of the Lingsang family who had 
revolted in I<ham and fled to Central Tibet, chased by the Chinese communists. 

Since these people were Shechen Kongtrul's sponsors back in I<ham, he was 
obligated to perform rituals for their support, for which he lingered on the banks 
of the river for five days. This turned out to be disastrous-the Chinese commu-
nists arrived, and he was arrested and whisked off to China. 

I don't know how he died. He must have been transported from Central Tibet 
back to Derge in the east, because people saw him there, and then he was taken 
to China. 

It was very sad. He was only about fifty years old. 

Unfortunately, now I must give you another example of my own headstrong 
tenacity. As I was preparing to go to Sikkim, the I<armapa told me, •At first, stay 
at my disciple Banyak Ating's estate in Sikkim for a while, then go on to Nepal to 
the Great Stupa at Boudha in the Kathmandu valley. You should build a monastery 
next to it. 

·someone at the stupa has promised to give me land and I have a letter from 
one of the rulers in the valley pledging building materials. It has been six months 
since I was supposed to send a lama to oversee this project and I think you would 
be ideal for the job;" 

The next day, as I sat in front of our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, someone walked 
in with a stack of eight letters. As he handed them to me one by one, he told me 
whom the letters were for. Each was addressed to a specific official in the Nepali 
government, as well as one to the land sponsor and one to the secretary of King 
Mahendra of Nepal. There was even a letter to I<hunu Lama, an Indian master, 
asking him to come, though I doubted he would. 

·sad times will befall the country of Tibet,• the I<armapa said. ·I want you to 
build a monastery in Nepal. I am already making preparations to send half of our 
statues, books and ritual implements to Nepal, little by little. But there has to be a 
place to receive them-a monastery. You must go on ahead and build one;" 

He continued, •I have chosen you for good reason: you are capable of being my 
representative. I will send all the necessary attendants and secretaries, and give 
you a high position as lama. So pack all your things and go south to Kyirong, on 
the border of Nepal. From there proceed to the Kathmandu valley and immedi-
ately begin construction on a major monastery. The construction must be of fine 
quality and must be completed within three years. We should agree on this right 



Amazing Masters in Lhasa 311 

now-there's no point lingering here in Tibet in the blind belief that everything 
11ill tum out okay.• 

·pardon me, Wish-Fulfilling Jewel!• I said in disbelief. "How on earth can some-
one like me fulfill such a command? I am not that educated. I am not an eloquent 
teacher nor am I tall and handsome. It appears to me that you've chosen the poor-
tst candidate. Sending me not only would be an unwarranted punishment, but I 
am sure would also end in failure:' 

Looking back on it, I can't help laughing at my audacity. 
·rn Kham there are so many great Kagyu monasteries including Surmang; I 

continued, ·each with capable and distinguished lamas. You have the power to 
command the best to be your representative and they will obey you-wouldn't 
'that be better? All you have to do is express your wishes and I am sure any of them 
.v.ill do as you say. That's what you should do-because I can't possibly take such 
a position. Even if I did go, no one would listen to me. I couldn't possibly promise 
to complete the monastery in three years. I am more like a hungry ghost in hu-
man form who has been given the name 'lama: Choosing me to represent you will 
result in nothing but disgrace to the Dharma:' 

Then I stood up and did three prostrations in order to demonstrate the firm-
ness of my resolve. 

"When someone like me takes the position of a high Buddhist master; I added, 
'it will turn people against the Dharma and cause them to break their samayas:' 

"Don't you bother worrying about such things-leave them to me; the Karmapa 
replied, undeterred. ·And, by the way, I think people will have faith in you:' 

·rm not trying to say that you are wrong; I protested, ·but it seems to me you 
are trying to make a dog behave like a lion-and I just don't see how it's possible:' 

·You really are an obstinate man!· the Karmapa exclaimed. "Senselessly stub-
born. What a shame! You obviously don't realize what great benefit this would 
be to both the Buddha's teachings and sentient beings. I have great hopes for you. 

"I am not in short supply of important lamas clamoring for a higher rank and 
position; many of them are eager to go and do exactly what I am asking of you. It's 
ashame, but forget about it-at least for the time being:' 

That's what he said, but it was of no help. I still wouldn't obey him. 
This exemplifies my obstinate pride. I now regret not using that opportunity to 

fulfill his wish, because of course he was right: that was exactly when a monastery 
in Nepal would have brought great benefit. 

But what did I know? I'm just an ordinary fool-and yet I was totally convinced 
of my own judgment. 



312 CENTRAL TIBET 

Around this time the Karmapa inquired, ·You are going to Nepal anyway, aren't 
you?" 

•Why?" I asked. 
•There is a place there called Maratika. That is where you should go to do your 

three-year retreat: 
·where is it located, Rinpoche?" 
·Not too far from the Kathmandu valley. If you can do some longevity practice 

there during the three years, you will have good results: 
•Please, don't force me to do that!" I pleaded. •of course, I have heard of 

Maratika, where the Lotus-Born master attained accomplishment. But how will 
I be able to obtain provisions? I don't know anyone there. Please, don't ask me to 
do this: 

So I didn't obey his wish that time either. 
The Karmapa was very unusual in how he spoke. When he formulated his wish-

es, they often didn't sound so much like suggestions, but rather like possibilities 
that would actually happen. Still, in those days, I obviously didn't trust in him 
enough to listen. 

And so those were two times when I failed to fulfill his explicit wishes. 

When I think of all the precious treasures that were lost from those days, I can 
hardly believe my foolishness. In particular, the books in the library at Tsurphu 
were impressive; knowing what later happened to that priceless library, I regret 
not having asked to borrow a few books for my trip to Sikkim. 

One in particular comes to mind: Karmey Khenpo's annotated version of the 
Treasury of Knowledge. Not only was it in his own large calligraphy, but between 
the lines he had inserted clarifications that he had personally requested from the 
author, Kongtrul. The whole text with Kongtrul's own commentary filled three 
volumes. At Tsurphu I asked to borrow these and the Karmapa agreed. But when 
1 tracked down the books, they had already been borrowed by Dilyak Drubpon, 
the retreat master. 

•1 have already asked our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel to lend these books to me. Could 
you please have them sent over?" I requested. 

•By the Three Jewels I will not!" Dilyak Drubpon responded. •I am not part-
ing with these books-not for anything! And I'll tell you why: Karmapa is al-
ways sending people over to ask me questions. Without these books, how can 
I give proper answers? You know I didn't do extensive studies while young, 
except for the rudimentary texts, the Way of a Bodhisattva and the Triple 



Amazi11g Masters in Lhasa 313 

Precepts. I am not that well educated and these three volumes are all I've got 
to back me up. 

"It doesn't help that you say our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel has sent you; he's the one 
I'm working for too. Now you come here proclaiming you want to tear out my two 
eyes and leave me blind! By the Three Jewels, I swear I'm not parting with these 
books~ 

We we·re very close friends, so what could I do? I couldn't argue with him, so 
.I tried another angle, •you don't need to hold on to them like that. The Karmapa 
really said I could borrow them for just a short time; let me take them for a little 
while.· 

"No, by the Three Jewels, you will not!" he exclaimed emphatically. 
Dilyak Drubpon was a real meditator and a first-class person. But once he 

swore "By the Three Jewels!" there was nothing you could do. Had it been anybody 
else, there is no doubt 1 would have requested the Karmapa to lean on him. But 
not wanting to make it into a bigger issue, I let it pass and I never got the chance 
to read the books. 

One day at Tsurphu, 1 was sitting with Dilyak when a close friend and relative of 
his, who had just finished studying dialectics and logic at Sera College, came into 
the room. Drubpon himself was more the simple meditator type. 

"What do you understand by emptiness?" his friend asked, teasingly. 
"Emptiness is very simple. It is what we call Mahamudra and Dzogchen," 

Drubpon replied. 
"You silly man! You can't define emptiness by using just another word; it's sup-

posed to be the basis of all the teachings, and yet you can't describe it. You sit here, 
pretending to be the Karmapa's assistant teacher, you fraud!" 

"Okay, you define it, if you're so eager," demanded Drubpon. 
"How can any meaning be communicated without using defining characteris-

tics? Do you think the ultimate truth will just dawn on you by surprise? You need 
to use words and concepts. You idiot!" replied his friend. 

Drubpon replied, "If you think you can demonstrate emptiness using words 
and concepts, then you're the foolish man, beyond compare!" 

They went on bickering and laughing like this. 
Drubpon then turned to me and said, "You see, without Karmey Khenpo's an-

notated version, how can I fend off guys like this?" 



314 CENTRAL TIBET 

Later, when Dilyak Drubpon managed to get out of Tibet and reached Sikkim, 
he told me, "I didn't get to bring the books with me. I wanted to bring them and l 
really tried, but it didn't work out~ 

"How could you have lost them?"IIamented. 
"By the Three Jewels! You weren't there to see the chaos and confusion. No 

one knew whether the next morning they would be alive or a corpse. Like clouds 
moving across the autumn sky, nothing was predictable. It was a time of intense 
turmoil and danger. 

"That's the state we were in, while you were here in Sikkim relaxing and having 
a good time:' 

Still, it often comes to my mind that those notes-Kongtrul's own replies 
to Karmey Khenpo-would have been such a wonderful embellishment to the 
Treasury of Knowledge! 

At Tsurphu I had been lucky enough to see The Great Scroll Depicting the 
Hundred Wondrous Deeds. I consider it to be one of the most impressive examples 
of meaningful art in this world. In one painting after the other, this enormous 
scroll depicts all one hundred of the miracles performed by the fifth Karmapa at 
the Chinese emperor's court. Its text is in four languages: Chinese, Mongolian. 
Tibetan and another I couldn't recognize. 

This remarkable scroll is more than forty arm spans long and several feet in 
height. It shows the sixteen arhats as saints appearing in cloudbanks, plus aU the 
amazing events that took place inside the emperor's private chambers during em· 
powerments, such as how the emperor saw the mandala of the deities and the day 
three suns arose. 

I didn't know the scroll existed until Dzongsar .Khyentse came to Tsurphu and 
asked to see it. When we unrolled it, Dzongsar Khyentse remarked, "I have never 
seen anything like this in this world! Other masters have displayed miracles while 
in China, but nothing like this:' One morning, Dzongsar Khyentse and I looked 
the scroll over, reading through all the narrations from beginning to end. 

I heard that three copies of the scroll had been made: one in China, this one at 
Tsurphu and one other that was destroyed in a fire many centuries ago. On the 
paintings were nineteen seals of verification by lhe emperor's own stamp. It would 
be a wonderful thing to preserve in book form. 

I also tried to tease Dilyak Drubpon about not having carried out this precious 
scroll. But again he retorted, "Who are you to say I'm not a tough guy? You think 
you're tough, lolling around in Sikkim while we were on the verge of death?" 



Amazing Masters in Lhasa 315 

What could I say to that? 
But then I remembered something and teased him a bit more, saying, ·so who 

packed the Karmapa's bags? I hear there were one hundred porters merely to carry 
the tsampa flour, dried cheese and meat. Couldn't you have just replaced just one 
bag of food with the scroll? Qidn't you know that the king of Bhutan had offered to 
be the Karmapa's benefactor? Who would starve to death with the king as spon-
sor? And while I'm at it, how about all the other representations of body, speech 
and mind that were left behind?• 

All joking aside, I really was worried that this precious treasure had been lost. 
But I later discovered it was safe in Sikkim.14,

Leaving Tibet 

Shortly before I left Tsurphu, I told the Karmapa, "I don't feel it's appropriate for 

me to stay here any longer:-
: ·"Why notr he asked. 
: "I have two children and their mother to worry about. While you can fly off like 
a bird in the sky wherever you desire; I, on the other hand, cannot move about so 
freely and I'm afraid I'll get stuck here in Tibet. My only wish is to go somewhere 
without a single Chinese .communist. I have a short list of several places for your 
consideration. First, there is the Khenpa valley, a small hidden place in Bhutan. 

My next choice is lower Bhutan itself and my third choice is Sikkim. There is also 
a hidden valley in the district of Solu Khumbhu in Nepal and in the western part 

of Nepal there is a place called Nubri." 

I mentioned the connection my uncle had to some people in Nubri, explaining, 
"A lama living there descends from King Trisong Deutsen and, since he's a disciple 
of my uncle, if we go there at least we won't starve. Please give me your advice as 

to the best place to go. The thought of staying 
in Tibet keeps me awake at night." 

One of the Karmapa's lamas leaned over and 
said, "You don't have to worry about a thing; 

you are under our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel's pro-

tection. Just stay with our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel 
and he will take care of everything." 

I replied, "That wouldn't be appropriate.

While I was at Tsurphu, a group of practitioners from Nubri happened to come; 
they insisted on being given the entire transmission for the Tukdrub Barchey 
Kunsel. The Karmapa gave me the task, which took nineteen days. After that the 
Karmapa said, "Write down your choices on a piece of paper for me; I'll tell you 
the result of my divination tomorrow morning." 

Early the next day the Karmapa said, "Forget about your other choices. Go to 
Sikkim. I will give you a letter of introduction to my disciple Banyak Ating, and 
he will take care of you. In any of the other valleys, it will be more difficult for you 
and, anyway, you are not familiar with their dialects." 

With those words I had his permission to leave Tibet. 

I had left my two sons and their mother at Drong monastery, north of the city, 
and sent a messenger to fetch them. When they arrived I told them of my decision 
to go to Sikkim. 

Hearing of this my brother-in-law Wangdu, who was a Central Tibetan aristo-
crat, exclaimed, "The Po tala palace in the heart of the Lhasa valley is like a splendid 
tangka painting upon which the Dalai Lama shines like a radiant sun. How can the 
Chinese communists be any match for such a lofty presence? The communist army 

may run over you Khampas without 
any problems, but there is no way in 
the world that they can conquer the 
Central Tibetan government:' 

"The Chinese army has an incredible 
number of battalions, each with thou-
sands of soldiers; I replied. "Please tell 
me the exact number of conscripts in 
the Central Tibetan army, which you 
consider so formidable. I wonder if 
they can muster any more than a mere 
ten or twenty thousand troops. When 
a mountain comes crumbling down in 
an avalanche, simple trees and bushes 
are unable to hold it back." 

My brother-in-law would hear 
nothing of it. His attitude was typical 
of most the Central Tibetan aristoc· 
racy; unwilling to entertain even the 



Leaving Tibet 321 

thought that his country was about to be crushed. So, my wife and her family 
simply refused to go. 

As one of them put it, •There is no way we can just abandon our property and 
wealth!• 

So I left on my own. 

Just before my departure for Sikkim, a Tibetan woman told me she had good 
news, ·The Panchen Lama, who is the Buddha of Boundless Light in person; the 
Dalai Lama, who is Avalokiteshvara; and Mao Tse-tung, who I am sure is the bo· 
dhisattva Vajrapani, are meeting together. This is a good omen for world peace:' 

Undaunted, and long before any fighting broke out in Lhasa, I left, with only my 
trusted servant at my side. Probably no one else ran away as early as I did-and so 
I managed never to hear a single shot fired from a communist's rifle. As they say, 
when the fox comes, the biggest chicken is the first to run into the henhouse. 

It didn't take that long to get from Lhasa to Sikkim. Our small party traveled 
on horseback at a pleasant pace, with yaks carrying our luggage. If you don't stop 
along the way, you can get to Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim, in twenty days. 

In Sikkim, I was received by the Karmapa's disciple, Banyak Ating, a generous 
and dignified statesman and a chief minister in the Sikkimese government. He 
had become an important benefactor and given many rice fields to the Karmapa, 
enough to produce five hundred bushels of rice annually. He said I could stay with 
him as long as I lived, offering me enough cornfields to feed ten people. Later, he 
rebuilt the house I was in, transforming it into a small temple. Over the next few 
years, I tried to persuade my brother, Tenga Tulku, to leave Kham and join me in 
Sikkim-but one day I received news that he had already gotten sick and died. 

After receiving several insistent letters from me, my brother·in-law Wangdu 
eventually brought my wife and sons to join me. But after he arrived in Sikkim, he 
wanted us all to turn around and head back to Tibet. 

•You've come to this unknown, godforsaken valley; he said. ·rm sure the Red 
Army won't follow you here-and if they did, they would starve to death! I've 
heard there is no proper food hereabouts, and it's so hot you can barely survive. I 
certainly won't stay. And I will not allow my old mother to stay here. I am sure she 
will die from hunger or the heat:' 

We had quite a lively discussion and it ended only when I swore that there was 
no way I was going to return to Tibet. 

·Even if someone were to bind and drag me, I won't go, nor will I let my two 
children go back; I told him. •you are free to do what you want. When some· 



322 IN EXILE 

one escapes from death row, they don't care whether the landscape goes up or 
down-they just run. For me, leaving Tibet was like getting out of prison. There's 
no way I'm going back!" 

Wangdu retorted, "1 don't sleep well here; 1 toss and turn, longing to be back 
in Tibet:' So finally Wangdu packed up his things and took his mother back to 
Tibet. 

1 didn't see him again for many years-when the Chinese government released 
him after twenty years in prison. 

Looking back 1 see it's only thanks to the Karmapa that 1 survived outside of 
Tibet-it certainly wasn't on my own merits.1 had a wife and children, and 1 hadn't 
brought a single possession from Kham-just a few minor articles from Lhasa. 

1 sent a trusted servant to Kham to tell my close relatives, friends and those 
under my care in the monasteries all to join me in Sikkim. But many of them were 
too distracted by their yaks and sheep, and taking care of what they considered 
important matters, to even consider leaving. 

1 had requested from Lachab-which was still very prosperous thanks to 
Samten Gyatso's tulku-some important articles and funds, but my wishes went 
unheeded. Of my Dharma possessions, 1 hadn't brought a thing from Kham. By 
the time 1 was living in exile, Nangchen already had survived so many invasions 
and political upheavals over the centuries that people found it unimaginable that 
things might be unsafe in a monastery this time. 

Chokyi Nyima's monastery was also very wealthy. If we had had the chance to 
bring some valuables from there, we would have been well off. But before a mes-
senger could be sent there, all links to Tibet-both transportation and communi-
cation-were cut. Besides a few personal possessions and the daily necessities that 
we could carry, 1 arrived in Sikkim utterly destitute. 

1 was quite sad about some things that were lost. For instance, my teacher 
Kyungtrul's Treasury of Nyingma Songs in two volumes was a dear treasure; back 
in Kham, 1 had used it frequently to chant at funerals, healing ceremonies or feast 
offerings. Of course, 1 brought it with me to Central Tibet, but 1 couldn't bring it 
to Sikkim without risking strong suspicions or outright objections. The same went 
for other valuable article~;, ~;uch a~; ~;hrine object~;. So I brought only a ~;et of aver-
age-quality ritual objects, leaving behind all the heirlooms. 

Because Samten Gyatso had been extremely exacting when commissioning 
statues, the images in the new shrine room at Fortress Peak were of the highest 
possible quality for his time. But 1 couldn't bring a single statue nor even one book 



Leaving Tibet 323 

from his extensive library. They were all supposed to belong to his reincarnation, 
the young tulku. 

Anyway, this lost book by Kyungtrul had been one of my prized possessions.s.u 
The first Kongtrul had written a practice in which one honors all the masters in 
the lineage of the Great Perfection. In his text, he mentions that right after the 
feast offering, •at this point you can include a suitable number of songs from the 
lineage gurus~ He also mentions great benefits from singing these spiritual songs, 
quoting from the tantras that ·the wakefulness of knowing the natural state will 
expand boundlessly within one's personal experience~ 

Kyungtrul took upon himself the task of collecting these songs. One might 
think he got slightly carried away, since he began his search with Longchenpa's 
\"ast Treasury of Dharmadhatu.341 His justification was this: •If you want to have 
songs that express the ultimate view of the three sections of the Great Perfection, 
I personally don't see any way to exclude Longchenpa's masterwork~ 

Following that, he collected songs from all the early Dzogchen masters, as well 
as from every important lineage master of Tibet. In the end, the collection itself 
lilled two volumes. At one point, he even wanted to include a lengthy scripture 
containing profound songs by Longchenpa, the Treasury of the Way of Ahiding.a-.6 

Samten Gyatso convinced him not to keep endlessly expanding his collection, 
saying, ·or course these too would be appropriate, but then there would be no end 
if someone wanted to chant all the songs during the feast offering-unless you 
want to make it last two days~ 

A few other precious texts did, however, manage to make their way out of Tibet 
in those days; for example, Sam ten Gyatso had an exquisite calligraphic version of 
the Three Sections of the Great Perfection that I was able to get out. 

When he saw my personal copy of the Three Sections, Dudjom Rinpoche was 
extremely impressed by its high quality. ·What a wonderful level of craftsmanship 
in both writing and spelling you have in eastern Tibet!• he exclaimed. ·How amaz-
ing! I haven't seen anything this perfect before. Who did it?• 

I answered that Samten Gyatso had an old attendant who was extremely me-
ticulous and renowned for rarely making a spelling mistake. Samten Gyatso per-
sonally sponsored the handcopying of thirty volumes of scriptures connected to 
Chokgyur Lingpa's New Treasures and this attendant was the one who did most 
ofthework. 

My aunt, Tashi Chimey, and her husband were the caretakers of my gompa, 
and her husband was extremely fond of this text. He wrapped it in several layers 



324 IN EXILE 

of special brocade, always taking extreme care. Later on, when 1 was ordered by 
our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel to come up to Central Tibet, I sent for the text. My uncle 
then had a copy made for himself by a monk from my father's monastery, who was 
passing through on a pilgrimage. 

Later, by the grace of the Three Jewels, the person who was carrying the text 
back to Kham got lost in the turmoil of the Chinese invasion and, having no idea 
what a treasure he was carrying, handed it over to a tulku from my gompa with the 
words, •This book belongs to Fortress Peak~ That's why we have this very accurate 
version of the text today. 



35 

My Sikkimese host and benefactor, Banyak Ating, was a very special person. While 
roung, he had been a secretary to the fifteenth Karmapa, Khakyab Dorje; Banyak 
loved him dearly. He spent three years with the Karmapa in Kham and had im-
mense faith and devotion. 

Once he returned home to Sikkim, Banyak married and raised a family. Most 
of his household shared his deep devotion to the Karmapa; you rarely see such a 
level of faith. One day, after our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel had returned from visiting 
the major sacred places in India, Ban yak invited the Karmapa to the estate. Banyak 
himself was holding a white scarf and a bundle of incense, as he stood at the head 
of a long line of monks wearing special yellow shawls. 

Banyak later told me that his wife-who, incidentally, was Tibetan-wasn't so 
pleased that her important husband was bowing to a Tibetan priest. In a critical 
tone, she asked, "Oh my! If you treat this Karmapa Lama in such a fashion, what 
will you do if the Dalai Lama comes?" 

Banyak, however, was not so easily influenced and replied, "The Karmapa has 
been the guru of all my ancestors, as well as of the Sikkimese kings. He is our ref-
uge and protector; it is from him that we get our teachings. There is no one more 
important than one's own root guru-not even the king of another country, even 
if he happens to be the Dalai Lama~ _ 

Banyak's family were descendants of the old Sikkimese kings, though not in 
the main royal lineage; instead they held positions as minister or governor, which 
were passed on from father to eldest son. He once heard that the queen herself had 
said, ·Maybe Banyak should be called King Ating, he's so powerful. What's the use 
of having another king?" 

Banyak just laughed and said, "I wouldn't do anything against His Majesty. But 
if that is the talk of the court, it's not a good omen for Sikkim's future and perhaps 
I should retire~ And he did so soon after. 



326 IN EXILE 

64. 
The family in 

Sikkim 

One evening, we were sitting around talking with two of Banyak's daughters. 
One said, "It would have been much better if the Karmapa had never come here. 
It was no good-he really shouldn't have come:' 

"Why?" I asked. 
"Well, he wasn't a buddha after all; was the reply. "We cooked his food and we 

saw with our own eyes that he ate it. Later, we looked in the toilet after he had 
been there and we saw what was lying inside the bowl! So, realizing that he is just 
a human being, we have now lost half of our faith. It would have been much better 
if he hadn't come to our house at all." 

"Oh, hush!" their father said. "Don't go on with this childish talk. Of course he's 
a human being! What did you expect?" 

They had expected him to be a deity without a real physical body. The whole 
household did not use the Karmapa's name when referring to our Wish-Fulfilling 
Jewel; they called him "our buddha" -not the buddha, but our buddha. 

Of course he was a human being. When the Buddha was in Sarnath and 
Bodhgaya, he too had a human body. 

Banyak himself was not that childish; he was a person of great sophistication. 
He was also a man of means, with generosity to match. Every year, on a particular 
date, he had five hundred porters each carry a full load of rice up to Rumtek, the 
Karmapa's monastery in Sikkim. Whatever the monastery couldn't use, they were 
free to sell. 

Wouldn't you call someone like that a benefactor? 

At Banyak's estate I went into a three-year retreat. While I was in retreat, my 
sons Chokyi Nyima and Chokling were learnin-g to read. There was a village school 
nearby and Banyak insisted that they enroll there. But after just three days, Chokyi 

Nyima came home, appalled. 
"That school is useless!" he complained 

"The older kids show the younger ones how 
to trap birds and kill them. In the afternoon, 
behind the school, they pull out the feath· 
ers, roast the body over a small fire and eat 
the dead birds. How can I stay in such a 
place? I'm never going back!" 

"So what?" The young Chokling seemed 
unperturbed. However he only lasted a 
couple more days. 



Sikkim 327 

For his part Chokling was impossible to discipline. Once he was so naughty I 
was forced to dangle him out the window by his ankles, threatening to drop him if 
he didn't behave. Yet even hanging there upside down, he was still defiant. 

Sure enough, shortly afterward, he crawled out the same window trying to 
grab a branch and he fell. His playmate came running in, yelling that Lungtok-
Chokling's name in those days-had fallen out the window. Miraculously, he es-
caped with only a twisted ankle. And though his eyes were moist with tears, he 
bravely proclaimed that nothing was wrong. 

The two boys were very different. 
Threatening Chokyi Nyima did have an effect: It made him worse, ensuring 

he would never listen. So I soon figured out it was best to use the voice of reason 
with him. 

•What's the use of having the name of a big lama: I would tell him, ·when your 
monastery is lost in Tibet? Here we are, penniless in a foreign country and some 
children aren't interested in being educated. Even though they might have been a 
big lama in their last life, without proper education their only chance for a job will 
be as a porter, carrying heavy loads down the road in the scorching sun, with sweat 
pouring down their faces. How sad! 

•If only they could have studied while they were young tulkus! There is a Khampa 
saying: 'Today's meat and cream is tomorrow's shit: 

·sack in Kham we were like cream, and now we are like shit. Unless you study 
and learn to read and write now, you are going to be in trouble one day, I'm sure. 
You must have noticed how the porters sweat on the road; you're going to be like 
them if you don't do your daily lessons:" 

Once he got the point, Chokyi Nyima had no trouble studying. These gentle re-
minders were more effective than a hundred slaps with a cane. He would then even 
reprimand his younger brother, lecturing him on the virtues of a good education. 

However, no matter what you tried with Chokling, it had no effect at all; he 
would merely laugh at your attempt to reason with him, saying, ·What's there to 
worry about? I can carry a porter's load-1 don't care!• 

"" 
After I finished my retreat I was able to go on several pilgrimages. First, I visited 

Bodhgaya, one of the most sacred places in this world. As sutras tell us, the vajra 
throne in Bodhgaya is the site where the one thousand buddhas of this eon awaken 
to complete enlightenment. 047 



328 IN EXILE 

65. 
The Vajra Throne 

in Bodhgaya 

Samten Gyatso once told me that all who visit Bodhgaya just once in their life-
time have not wasted their life and can die without regret. With that in mind, and 
not wanting to die without having seen it, I headed off for Bodhgaya soon after 
arriving in Sikkim. I was looking forward to making prayers and pure wishes at 
that sacred place, though I didn't get to stay long on that first visit. 

I was also able to visit Bhutan several times. The first time, a Bhutanese digni· 
tary named Puntsok Wangdu of the drasho rank sent someone to invite me there. 
He had met Uncle Tersey and was quite devoted to the New Treasures; in fact he 
had repeatedly asked if any lamas from this lineage had left Tibet. When we met it 
was clear that he had a strong connection to our lineage and had especially great 
faith in Tsewang Norbu. In the Bumtang valley Puntsok Wangdu had built a new 
temple at a place called Moon Meadow.141 The Bhutanese way of making statues 
is to mix unspun cotton with clay, beat them together and then mold the statue 
from the mixture. In the shrine hall were exquisite life-size statues of the twelve 
manifestations of the Lotus-Born master, in fine detail according to the tradition 
of Tukdrub Barchey Kunse/. 

While we were visiting Moon Meadow, Puntsok Wangdu told me, ·rm de-
lighted that you have escaped the Chinese. Why don't you leave Sikkim and stay 
here? Although I am near the end of my life, I will sponsor you-I'll give you the 
Padmasambhava temple and build you a monastery~ 



Sikkim 329 

·1 can't stay right now; I replied. "The Karmapa sent me to Sikkim and he has 
pl~ed me with his benefactor Banyak. I can't just abandon that situation. It is very 
kind of you, but now is not the time." He died not long after that meeting. 

It was during this trip that I met the Queen Mother of Bhutan, who had been 
Uncle Tersey's patron. I was on a visit to a temple in Kalimpong, built in the style 
of thetotus-Born master's Glorious Copper-Colored Mountain, and it happened 
that she was also this temple at the time. 

·It's good you have left Tibet," she told me. "Near the Tibetan border is Lion 
Fortress Meadow, one of the five sacred places of Padmasambhava, where Yeshe 
Tsogyal meditated .... 9 I have some land just below it, and if you would like to 

stay there, I will support you. Its fields are big enough to support about ten 
people~ 

Having no plan to settle in Bhutan, I thanked her but said that for the time being 
I was fine in Sikkim, being supported by our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel and Ban yak. 

While Dzongsar Khyentse was staying in Gangtok, I had the opportunity to 
\isit him every morning for twenty-five days and to ask many questions. Since he 
was in semi-retreat, ordinarily he received no visitors; but because I was a descen-
dant of Chokgyur Lingpa, he showed me special kindness and allowed me to visit. 
Often he was alone, without any attendant whatsoever. 

Banyak Ating had deep faith in the Karmapa but not in many others- not even 
in Dzongsar Khyentse. But one day after seeing me walk into Gangtok every morn-
ing to meet Dzongsar Khyentse, Banyak asked me why I was going there. 

"In the entire land of Tibet and Kham, there is no equal to this master known as 
Dzongsar Khyentse. So I go to clear up a few points, even though I don't request 
any large body of teachings~ Dzongsar Khyentse was familiar with the writings 
of every single master I mentioned to him and 
he also knew all the termas of the different ter-
tons; people said he was the most learned mas-
ter of his time. Don't forget, this was no small 
achievement: There were many learned and ac-
complished masters during his day, but he was 
regarded as the "crest of the victory banner~ 

Hearing this Banyak wondered, "Hmmm . .. 
is he really all that special?" 

"Don't speak about him with even a hint of 
doubt; I replied. "There is no one else like him~ 

66. 
Dzongsar 
Khyentse under 
the Bodhi Tree 



330 IN EXILE 

It seems I raised some questions in Banyak's mind, for soon after, he began to 

visit Dzongsar Khyentse as well. And, being a steady-minded person, he never lost 
faith in him again. 

One day I asked Dzongsar Khyentse what teaching I should practice. •The Great 
Perfection will blaze like a wildfire during this coming age; he replied, paraphras· 
ing the famous prophesy, ·When the flames of the Dark Age rage rampantly, the 
teachings of the vajra vehicle of Vajrayana will blaze like wildfire:" 

Dzongsar Khyentse explained that during the early days of Buddhism in Tibet, 

when the Dharma was just beginning to spread, three masters-Padmasambhava, 

Vimalamitra, and Vairotsana-brought many tantric and Dzogchen teachings to 

Tibet. Several centuries later, when Atisha came to Samye and looked through all 
the original Indian manuscripts kept in the libraries there, he saw many that were 

no longer available in India. He was so impressed he exclaimed, ·such an abun· 
dance of teachings! Those three masters must have brought tantras directly from 
the secret treasury of the dakinis:"•so 

For a while, the teachings on the three inner tantras-Maha Yoga, Anu Yoga and 
Atl Yoga-flourished widely in an oral lineage from master to disciple. Later on, 

the Dzogchen teachings were mainly sustained by means of terma revelations. 

As Dzongsar Khyentse told me, ·Terma teachings were concealed to be re· 

vealed at particular periods later in history, and they appear in the forms most 

appropriate to the particular time periods in which they are revealed. Each rna· 
jor terton must reveal a minimum of three major themes: Guru Sadhana, Great 

Perfection, and Avalokiteshvara. In our time Old Khyentse and Chokling were 
specifically endowed with seven transmissions:" 

Dzongsar Khyentse continued explaining that over the centuries, various cycles 
of Dzogchen teachings came to light and spread among people. The older tra· 
dition flourished all the way until the time of Chetsun Senge Wangchuk. Later 

. on, Longchenpa codified the teachings into the Four Branches of Heart Essence. 
Later still, there were many other revelations until Jigmey Lingpa, who was the 

reincarnation of Longchenpa, revealed the famous Nyingtig cycle, the Innermost 
Essence.•u 

So each age has had its particular teaching of the Great Perfection meant 
especially for that time. Recently Khyentse, Kongtrul and Chokgyur Lingpa 
brought to light several cycles of the Great Perfection. And, as is well known, 

Chokgyur Lingpa personally revealed seven different cycles of Dzogchen in· 
structions. 



Sikkim 331 

[n our time, two particular teachings will be very influential: one revealed by 
the great Khyentse (the Chetsun Nyingtig) and one by Chokgyur Lingpa (the Heart 
Essence of Samantabhadra). These cycles of teachings were practiced by the two 
siddha kings who lived in recent times: the great masters Shakya Shri and Adzom 
Drukpa, both disciples of Old Khyentse. 

·wruch Dzogchen practice should I focus on?•l then asked. 
Ozongsar Khyentse recommended that I focus on the Heart Essence ofSaman-

I!Jbhadra, praising its suitability for this age. He quoted the last statement made 
by the Lotus-Born master in the sadhana section of the text: 

These ultimate instructions 1 
Of extreme secrecy I 
Will, at the ultimate end of this age, 1 
Spread the heart teachings of Samantabhadra. I 

Another day, I asked Dzongsar Khyentse, •people like myself, who don't know 
much of anything, have a hard time discerning which are the most important 
among all the revelations contained in the Treasury of Precious Termas. We are 
like children picking flowers in a huge meadow, trying to choose the most beauti-
ful. Which do you consider the most important~ 

•For the guru aspect, there is none greater than Guru Chowang's Tenth Day 
Practice in Eight Chapters; it is sovereign among all guru sadhanas: Dzongsar 
Khyentse answered. ·For the yidam aspect, the Lotus-Born master taught the 
Eight Sadhana Teachings, and Nyang-Ral's version is eminent. The most impor-
tant dakini practice is the Black Vajra Yogini, also revealed by Nyang-Ral Nyima 
Ozer. These three are the most important among all terma revelations:"252 

I also asked about the Three Sections of the Great Pelftction. 
•It is the combined heart essence of Padmasambhava, Vairotsana and Vuna-

lamitra that they received from their guru Shri Singha, their primary guru for 
the teachings of the Great Perfection.251 So far it hasn't been widely propagated 
and practiced in Tibet; it's a concealed teaching, meant to be practiced in hidden 
places. I believe the time is yet to come when it will benefit a great many beings. I 
wouldn't suppose those three masters combined their efforts for no purpose-en-
lightened beings who can see the future wouldn't do something pointless, would 
they~ That's all he would say. 

•There are some precious guidance manuals in the T11ree Sections, but it all 
seems very short to me: I said. 



332 IN EXILE 

·only the Lotus-Born guru can condense so many teachings into a single vol-
ume, no one else. And, by the way, do guidance manuals have to be extensive? Tell 
me, what exactly do you think is missing in those teachings?· 

Of course he wasn't expecting an answer-it was obvious the Three Sections 
lacked nothing. 

·When I look at the Three Sections; he continued, •I see something complete, 
without a single aspect missing. I have heard others say that they felt it wasn't all 
written down, but I don't see it that way': 

Then I requested, ·Tell me about the Dzogchen teachings': 
•They are incredibly precious. Instructions on the Great Perfection are 

found in both the oral lineage of the Nyingma school, transmitted from master 
to student, and in the terma revelations. Among the termas, the foremost col-
lection is the Four Branches of Heart Essence, containing teachings from both 
Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra. In their particular time, these instructions 
benefited multitudes and many practitioners ascended to the vidyadhara level by 
applying them. •s• 

·The Lotus-Born master, with great compassion and wisdom, ensured that 
each generation would have a specific teaching meant for that time. Moreover, 
they would be guaranteed a short lineage, unpolluted by damaged samayas and 
with the blessed breath of the dakinis still warm. That is why we now have so many 
sadhanas from over various centuries based on the Three Roots. 

·some people wonder what is the point of having such variety-but there are 
many good reasons. One is the immediate effect at the time of revelation: it's like 
having a fresh crop, rather than food from last year. In each age, there are wor-
thy disciples ready to be brought to maturity and they must be given the proper 
empowerments. Other beings must be benefited indirectly, by planting the seeds 
for their future liberation. And the Buddha's teachings must be. supported to en-
sure the happiness of beings. This was Padmasambhava's concern and he made 
certain of this for many generations into the future. His was indeed an immense 
kindness': 

·What do you suggest I personally practice?· I then asked. 
·Take Tukdrub Barchey Kunsel as your main teaching; he replied. ·since you 

are a descendant of its revealer, Chokgyur Lingpa, regard him as your main guru 
and supplicate him one-pointedly. In this way, you have a practice complete with 
guru, yidam and dakini. Don't forget this! Among all of Chokgyur Lingpa's termas, 
Tukdrub was revealed without any hindrance and is extremely profound. Practice 
it and you will find nothing lacking. When obstacles are removed, realization oc-
curs spontaneously, so focus on that practice! . 



Sikkim 333 

"As you are a descendant of Chokgyur Lingpa, 
the sublime deity you practice should be con-
nected with your family line. The Tukdrub cycle 
is unexcelled in that the Lotus-Born master has 
a circle of twelve distinct deities, each of which is 
indivisible from him. Tukdrub represents a unique 
kind of sadhana, in which the guru and the yidams 
are practiced indivisibly~ 

"Whom should I regard as the guru?" I asked. 
"Supplicate Chokgyur Lingpa!" Dzongsar 

Khyentse replied. ·That will be sufficient!" 
In this way I found the answers to a wide range 

of questions. 
During this same time, Trulshik Rinpoche was in Gangtok and also received 

teachings from Dzongsar Khyentse, who was one of his main root gurus. Trulshik 
later told me that he too had asked whom he should follow in the future. Dzongsar 
Khyentse told him there would be no one better for him than Dilgo Khyentse. 

Dzongsar Khyentse later passed away in Gangtok. 

One day, three of the people from Nubri whom I had met at Tsurphu showed 
up in Sikkim and insisted I return with them to Nubri to give the New Treasures. 
They refused to leave without me. During this time the Karmapa was giving some 
very important teachings on two of the great Kongtrul's five famous treasuries: the 
Treasury of Kagyu Tantric Teachings and the Treasury of Ora/Instructions. This 
event took place at Rumtek and I encouraged them to remain in order to receive 
these. But after those teachings ended, they again refused to leave without me. 

Even though Banyak happily provided my family with loads of rice, I didn't feel 
we should continue being a financial burden on him. And instead of assisting the 
Karmapa, I became worried that I was diverting funds from him, since Banyak 

Ating was the Karmapa's main spon-
sor. So I began to think about how we 
could move. 

Since I was still occasionally the 
Karmapa's assistant, I had to ask his 
permission to leave. One day, I went 
over to pay my respects to our Wish-
Fulfilling Jewel. with a plan in mind.

The sixteenth 

Karmapa 

"I would like to ask your permission to leave 
Sikkim; I told him. 

"Where are you planning to go?" asked 
the Karmapa. 

"I am heading for Nubri in the mountains of 
Nepal," I replied. "I know some people there that 
I once met in Tibet. Those asking me to come 
are the descendants of King Trisong Deutsen I 
told you about. They are gentle people and their 
devotion is steadfast. I know the people ofNubri 
are of humble means, but they are persistent in 
their requests for me to come." 

In fact, the three of them were waiting out-
side at that very moment. 

I added, "But I'm afraid of hurting Ban yak Ating's feelings by leaving abrupt!( 
The Karmapa replied, "No need to worry. Banyak is a good man, all he wants to 

do is benefit the Dharma. I'm sure he won't mind your leaving." 
"If that's the case, I'll prepare to leave as soon as possible," I said. But the Karmapa 

asked me to stay on for a few more days. Banyak Ating, on the other hand, had 
other news for me. 

Around this time, Banyak discovered something more about my background. 
"I know you are a descendant of Chokgyur Lingpa; he announced. "Dzongsar 
Khyentse asked me what lamas I have living at my estate and I told him the 
Karmapa had sent me some lama descending from Chokgyur Lingpa's family line. 
To that Dzongsar Khyentse replied, 'Excellent! He's first class! The profound terma 
teachings he holds are very precious, believe me. You should help him to build a 
small monastery on the mountainside, accept him as your lama and embrace his 
Dharma lineage: He continued to extol Chokgyur Lingpa until I agreed. 

"We don't need to build a new monastery," Banyak continued, "since there is 
already a small gompa on my property. I would like to give it to you, so you can 
establish the New Treasures here, and I would like to help you restore it." 

I replied, "I have no such ambition, so I don't need to take you up on your kind 
offer." 

In short, though Banyak's intentions were good, his offer came a bit late. Since 
the folks from Nubri had no intention ofleaving without me, my mind was already 
made up. 

"You are a very strange man; he said. "We've just received word that a border 
skirmish has broken out between the Chinese and Nepali armies. Don't you know 



Sikkim 335 

that if China decides to, they can take over Nepal in less than one hour? Nepal 
does not have the resources to withstand an invasion. And now you think you can 
take refuge in such a small, helpless country? Sikkim, on the other hand, is de-
fended by India and if China decides to take on India, it will take at least ten days.· 
He repeated how foolhardy my plan was and chuckled. 

"J am sure I'll be fine, as the Karmapa has given me his assurance; I replied. 
'But I would be quite grateful if you could provide me with a letter of passage.· 

"I understand your reasons for leaving; Banyak answered, ·since it looks like 
these people from Nubri won't leave unless you go with them. Although I had 
hoped to be able to do more for you, as I recently mentioned to our Wish-Fulfilling 
jewel, I will do what I can to help~ 

Before leaving, I visited Dudjom Rinpoche once again to request the Kilaya 
empowerment from his own mind treasure. While there, I heard him tell several 
lamas from Ladakh and Khunu who were with him, ·oon't waste your time with 
me. Go up to Gangtok, because a real Jamyang Khyentse lives there! Don't you 
know that he is an emanation ofVimalamitra? Not only are you mistaken in com-
ing to see me instead, but it makes me uneasy that you are ignoring such a great 
master!• 

After the others left, he turned to me and said, ·These days I'm sending many 
people over to Gangtok to see Dzongsar Khyentse:" 

When I told him that I was going to Nepal, he asked, •What does the Karmapa 
sayt The Karmapa and Dudjom Rinpoche had great respect for each other. 

I assured him that I had received the Karmapa's blessing and Dudjom gave me 
his as well. Dudjom remarked that he had pure perception of my kids as being 
from the vidyadhara lineage of Chokgyur Lingpa and was pleased that they would 
be going with me. ·Nothing bad will happen to them; he assured me. 

As 1 was leaving, Banyak wished 
me well and said that if things didn't 
work out, I was always welcome to 
come back and take him up on his of-
fer. He also supplied me with a letter 
of passage for local authorities, which 
was very kind, though it only got 
me as far as the Nepali border. I had 
spent a very enjoyable three years at 
Banyak's; it was very beautiful.

Some of our host's household were weeping at our departure, worried that we 
would never meet again. As long as they could see us, they kept waving their white 
scarves. 

We soon arrived in Nepal- and, indeed, I never have had the chance to go back 
to visit my friends in Sikkim.

Nepal 

When I arrived in Nepal in 1961, some of the Karmapa's disciples took me to the 
Great Stupa in Boudha and I was put up by Chini Lama. The Karmapa had sent 
money to Chini Lama in order to build a monastery in Boudha. 

This was not an auspicious time to arrive in Nepal; the country was under 
a king, but the Congress Party had been mobilized for the first time, and the 
dream of democracy had made villagers swarm to the capital and fill the streets. 
They surrounded the royal palace waving sticks, crawling over the fence and 
yelling for the king to come out. With all the turmoil, it was hard to get any 
government official's attention, let alone deliver any of the letters the Karmapa 
had given me. 

Nevertheless, along with several of the Karmapa's benefactors, I went looking 
for land near the Swayambhu hill. I told Chini Lama, ·The Karmapa will pay for 
the purchase, but there has to be room for five hundred monks." 

·well, well," Chini Lama replied, •and who do you suppose is going to feed 
five hundred monks? These days people think twice before giving food to even a 
couple of monks. We have tried to maintain a temple for only four monks and it 
has been hard to find food just for them. 

•This is not a good time; the Congress Party is revolting against the mon-
archy. You should have come earlier. The official who made the promise to the 
Karmapa to provide cement and rebar at government expense may have done 
so in writing, but what good is that now? He's not in charge any longer; his writ-
ten promise isn't worth a glass of water! And by the way, the lama the Karmapa 
sent with money for the project brought only two thousand rupees, not twenty 
thousand. I understood that the money was for maintaining the stupa, so it's all 
spent-not a coin is left." 

He was correct about many things, for one-1 never got a single rupee from

Swayambhu 
Stupa, 1965 

IN EXILE 

That evening, I sat down and drafted 

a report of all this news to the Karmapa 
and had it delivered to our Wish-Fulfilling 
Jewel. I thought how stupid I had been not 
to do the Karmapa's bidding at the right 
time; circumstances had been very differ· 
ent three years earlier, when he told me 

to go to Kathmandu. Clearly, the time he 
wanted to send me there was just right 

Now one benefactor was dead, another 

was attending to his dying son, the former 

secretary to the king was in prison and I had 

no one to deliver the rest of the letters to. 

After a short stay in the Kathmandu valley, I proceeded to Nubri, together with 
my family, our welcoming party and some porters. I didn't stay there that long on 
my first trip; I arrived in the first month and came back to Kathmandu five months 
later. 

My two young sons were at an unruly age, so I tied a rope around their waists 

and kept them on a leash just like dogs. People were laughing, but there was no 
other way. Some complained, "What an evil man, treating his poor children like 

animals!· 

Chokling was particularly brazen and always looking for trouble. Sure enough, 

if it hadn't been for that rope, we would have lost him into the abyss on one of 
those steep roads. We had to pull him back up by the rope several times. 

At one point, in order to consecrate a large prayer wheel, we came within a day's 

walk of the Tibetan border, which was now patrolled by Chinese soldiers. Some 
Tibetans we met along the way told us 

we shouldn't go up there, since it was 

too _ close to the border- they asked 

us why we would want to go back af-

ter having just escaped. But we went 
anyway. Looking across the valley, we 

could see our lost homeland. 
Because we already had enough to 

carry and we had been told we could 
buy rice along the way, we hadn't 



~epa! 339 

brought any rice with us. To our dismay however, we discovered that, in that deso-
late region between Nepal and Nubri, there wasn't much food. 

When they were small, Chokyi Nyima would only eat if the food was well pre-
pared and tasty, but Chokling was far less picky-if there was food on the table, he 
would eat it. Once, we arrived in a village late at night after the shops had closed; 
that evening for dinner someone prepared big lumps of parched millet flour that 
had a· distinctive brown color. Chokyi Nyima took one look and exclaimed, "It's 
poop! I'm not going to eat poop! No way! How can people live here eating poop 
every day? Don't try to feed me poop ever again!" 

He would only eat some dried meat. I must admit it didn't take much imagi-
nation to think that it was excrement, so who could blame a small child for not 

wanting to eat it? 
On the other hand, Chokling said, "I don't care if it looks like shit- it's deli-

cious!· and he wolfed down both their servings. 

Before I left Rumtek, the Karmapa had told me, "In a letter to me, the Dalai 
Lama says that we should accumulate a great number of the VAJRA GURU mantra 
as a support for the Buddha's teachings. So, arrange for a VAJRA GURU accumula-

tion in Nubri:' 
I kept this command in mind, and it was the first thing we did at Lama Tashi 

Dorje's gompa in Nubri. He is a very stable, solid person, without a speck of deceit. 
His father had been a disciple of both Samten Gyatso and Karmey Khenpo. We 
met for the first time at Tsurphu, because Tashi Dorje's family was connected to 
Karmey Khenpo; the family had come to Central Tibet to find his reincarnation, 
who turned out to be a cousin of mine. 

At Nubri, for forty days the whole village participated in this VAJRA GURU ac-
cumulation, from morning until night, eating meals together. The villagers were 
tantric householders and they all joined in, husbands and wives together. All told, 
about three hundred people participated in the ceremonies and each evening they 
would all hand in the number of recitations they had done 
that day. 

I continued the same practice in other villages in 
Nubri, as well as in the Manang district. By the end of 
this trip, we had reached a total of nine hundred million 
recitations of the Lotus-Born master's mantra. The vil-
lagers also gave me offerings, so I returned to Kathmandu 
with a comfortable sum.

The third

The Cho/(ling ofNeten 

One of the most inspiring experiences on this trip was meeting the third Neten 
Chokling incarnation, who accompanied me to Nubri with his family.'55 Like all 
Chokling incarnations, he was very unusual. 

His previous incarnation had been a siddha, whose personality was such that 
once he began giving someone the pointing,out instruction, he would not allow 
that person to leave the room until he or she had recognized the nature of mind. 
The second Neten Chokling incarnation was predicted by Chokgyur Lingpa him-
self in a letter he gave to Karmey Khenpo, whereas Tsikey Chokling was recog-
nized by the great Khyentse.'56 

It is due to the third Neten Chokling that we have any of the New Treasures 
books at all. The Tsikey Chokling was both affluent and influential, and he man-
aged to have almost every single terma carved in woodblocks. Tsikey Gompa was 
known for its first, rate woodblock printing facility. The books printed from those 
blocks were disseminated far and wide, but the woodblocks were all destroyed-

burned during the Cultural Revolution. 

Neten-Pema • •fl':· 
Gyurmey '2~=:;;.~~~s;~~~~ 

Fortunately Neten Chokling managed to 
carry out a twenty, four volume set made 
from the Tsikey woodblocks, which he pre-
sented as an offering to Dzongsar Khyentse 
in the Sikkimese capital of Gangtok. This set 
forms the basis of what we use today as our 
present edition of Chokgyur Lingpa's New 
Treasures. After Dzongsar Khyentse passed 
away, Neten Chokling asked to borrow the 
books from his estate and used them to give 
the complete transmission at Tashi Dorje's 
gompa in Nubri. 



The third Neten Chokling was outstand-
ing in many ways. His benefactor told me 

· that one morning while the master was stay-
ing in his house, Neten Chokling repeated 
everything the benefactor had been think-
ing and dreaming during the night-he just 
saw it -all very clearly.'s7 

After our trip to Nubri, I saw Neten 

Tire Clroklilrg of Neten 

Chokling one last time, in Kathmandu. He tried to get me to travel with him to 
India, where he was headed. Since I was unable to come, he gave me his watch as 
a farewell present, saying he wanted me to have it since we would not meet again. 
He must have known that he would not live long. He was of tremendous service 
to the Chokling teachings; it was a great shame he died when he did-he was just 
forty-seven. 

Later on, after Neten Chokling had passed away, the New Treasures were re-
printed, and I have a set of those books bound in a large format. Oddly enough, the 
Bonpos arranged the first printing of our New Treasures outside Tibet. Later on, 
due to the kindness of Dilgo Khyentse and Lama Putse, and with the cooperation 
of American libraries in New Delhi- all of whom provided funds- a new edition 
was published. •s• 

Surely Lama Putse ranks highly among those who have upheld these teachings. 
First of all, once outside Tibet, he collected every single text available to him in 
print. Then he searched and added whatever others he could find. Many of these 
were from those brought back from Orgyen Tobgyal's first visit to Kham, a great 
kindness on his part. 

Lama Putse was the one who really knew all the scriptures of the New Treasures 
tradition and put the collection back together. So we can say that it is largely thanks 
to him that we have these written teachings of Chokgyur 
Lingpa in their present form.'s9 r-

Though Tsikey Chokling had block prints made for 
the whole collection, nowadays you probably can't find 
a single full set in all of eastern Tibet-thanks to the 
Chinese communists, who were so meticulous in their 
destruction. 

I hadn't left my obsession with caves behind in Tibet. I 
knew about a cave in Yolmo, one of Nepal's hidden lands,

called the Sun and Moon Cave, where the Lotus-Born master once stayed.* The 
cave was also under the care of Chini Lama and he generously gave me his consent 
to stay there until I died, which was very kind of him. So, one day I packed my bags 
and gathered the necessary provisions for a long retreat. I had five loads that includ-
ed such things as dried meat, butter and even blocks of salt that had been brought 
down from Nubri. I sent one of my trusted servants ahead to prepare the cave. 

The main effect from staying in solitude is that pointless activities naturally 
diminish. There is a famous statement, ·By abandoning activities, you approach 
the nature of nonaction~ That's the entire reason for staying in mountain retreats. 
Otherwise, without meditation practice how could there possibly be any point in 
staying in a cave. The beauty of a cave is that you don't have to build one, some 
people however miss this point and spend time interior decorating and making 
improvements. Forgetting the real purpose, they wind up thinking what a great 
cave they ·own· and live an ordinary life. 

At any rate, the Karmapa was due to arrive in Nepal for a visit. By the time he 
arrived, I was firmly resolved to stay in retreat at the Sun and Moon Cave until the 
end of my days. Everything was ready for my departure; four loads of provisions 
had already been packed and sent ahead. I had sent my sons to be educated at the 
monastery of our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel in Rumtek as I was planning to entrust 
their education to him. 

-r- So when we met at the Boudha Stupa, I asked the Karmapa about going to 
the cave in Yolmo. Unfortunately, however, an ownership dispute had broken out 
over the Swayambhu temple and the Karmapa refused to let me go, saying, ·You 
must stay in Kathmandu until this case is resolved." My plan to go to the cave was 
thwarted- the court case took nine years.'61 

But it wouldn't be my last attempt to try to stay in a cave. 

As in India, the society of Nepal was divided 
into a large number of different clans and castes. 
Each caste had its own position in relation to the 
others, comprising a rigid hierarchy. 

I found the Nepali people to be very gentle and 
generous. The family I stayed with belonged to the 
lowest caste of all. The head of the family was a 
very solid and kind man named Ram Lal. He had 
been the benefactor of Kharsha Rinpoche, the 
lama who had founded Nagi Gompa. 



The Chok/ing ofNeten 343 

Ram Lal had a humble little house in the center of Kathmandu and important 
people would never cross the doorstep. Until the old king eliminated some sec-
tions of the caste system, you couldn't even drink water poured from the hand 
of a person below your own caste-so no one would drink water from Ram Lal's 
house. Nonetheless that's where I lived when I first arrived. 

Some castes regarded themselves as very important. One of the dignitaries for 
whom I had a letter asked our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, ·what is wrong with this 
Tulku Urgyen? I don't know why, but he's staying in the house of someone in the 
lowest caste in Kathmandu. He must be able to find better accommodations. It's 
hard enough for us to meet with him, but if we use the old rules, I wouldn't even 
be able to get a cup of water~ 

Our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel later came to Kathmandu and asked me about this 
dignitary's complaint. 

·Whether these Newari people are high or low caste,· I explained, ·Ram Lal is 
a benefactor of the Dharma and of noble character. I merely need mention some 
intention in passing and he does not rest until he has satisfied it. Such selfless 
dedication is hard to come by~ 

So it came to pass that Ram Lal's house would have to suffice as my ·cave~ And 
through the many years of legal wrangling about the temple at Swayambhu, Ram 
Lal was the most helpful person of all. 

Thanks to Kharsha Rinpoche, I immediately had a group of supportive benefactors. 
When Kharsha Rinpoche passed on, his family, disciples and benefactors of-

fered his small hermitage Nagi Gompa to the Karmapa. 
One day, the Karmapa told me, ·You must stay at Nagi. You are an appropriate 

choice, since you are both Kagyu and Nyingma; as was Kharsha Rinpoche. 
As soon as the Karmapa had installed me as Kharsha Rinpoche's successor, his 

benefactors all accepted me and carried out my wishes. 
Back then, Nagi Gompa was very poor, as was the surrounding area; the local 

villagers didn't even fire the bricks they used to build their homes. Rain would leak 
through the roof of the room 1 stayed in, and the walls had large cracks. Such were 
the conditions while I lived at Nagi for the first few montl\s. 

I had the thought-not based on any profound sense of clairvoyance-that this 
was not going to be a stable dwelling for the future. •What,• I wondered, ·is the 
use of fixing this house?· So instead, I encouraged a few of Kharsha Rinpoche's 
benefactors to sponsor workers to begin digging into the hillside above, to create 
a flat area.

79. 
View of Nagi 

Gompa 

Later, I put an end to farming on the land around Nagi, thinking, "What's the 
use of killing insects just for a little food to eat?" However, I did allow Kharsha 
Rinpoche's daughters and his extremely haughty bursar to keep some fields for 
farming. 

So now I had two tasks: I divided my time between developing Nagi Gompa 
and supervising the legal proceedings. It was two years before I could start con-
struction on the new temple at Nagi. In those days, there was no road to Nagi; 
everything had to be carried by porters. We all had to walk up and down the hill 
countless times. 

Intending to benefit the future of Buddhism in the valley, we began building. I 
thought to myself that constructing a large Buddha statue would not only counter-
act the negativity accumulated through the legal dispute but also benefit sentient 
beings. In those days, a big Buddha statue of the size I intended could only be 
built of clay; without a building for protection, it would surely deteriorate in this 
climate. 

So, with the help of our local benefactors, l arranged to buy some more land to 
expand the acreage of the monastery. In those days, no one had the foresight or 
courage to spend considerable amounts for land. They habitually thought about 
the price ofland in square feet. I bought all the adjacent land I could, while Kharsha 
Rinpoche's tract only surrounded the old temple below. 



The Chokling ofNetell 345 

By adding together many smaller purchases, we managed to acquire a decent 
sized property on which Nagi Gompa now stands. 

During the construction, 1 was called down to the city below at least once a 
month to attend to another step in the endless legal proceedings. Then once again, 
I would walk up to Nagi and continue the work. I participated, building the three 
main statues in the shrine hall myself. Every so often, the statues had to be left to 
dry for a bit and then I would go back down to the valley. 

During the legal proceedings in Kathmandu, 1 made a short visit to Rumtek. 
Border skirmishes had again broken out between India and China, and I asked our 
WISh-Fulfilling Jewel if it might not be better for me to go stay at Paro in Bhutan. 

·Not at all; he abruptly replied. "You are definitely not allowed to go to Bhutan. 
Just stay in Nepal. Nothing is going to happen there with Chinese communists; I'll 
persona])y vouch for it:' 

Shortly after I left, the Red Army's presence at the borders became even more 
aggressive, and people began to evacuate Kalimpong and head for other places in 
India. The Karmapa, however, refused to leave Rumtek. 

The king of Sikkim paid him a visit and said, ·wiSh-Fulfilling Jewel, I would like 
to suggest that you come and spend a little time across the valley in Gangtok. If 
the Chinese army invades, I'm not sure we can protect you at Rumtek. So should 
the need arise, it would be much more convenient to go to India from there. Please 
consider moving your residence, if only temporarily:' 

·Nothing will happen to Sikkim and 1 am definitely not going anywhere; the 
Karmapa replied. ·u you believe in me, drop all these worries. Don't go to India. 
Nothing is going to happen here:' 

Then all the officials at Rumtek held a meeting and went before our Wish-
Fulfilling Jewel. The general secretary, with tear-fined eyes, presented a white scarf, 
pleading, ·we have just fled our homeland, barely escaping the Chinese invaders 
with our Jives. Once again, that dreaded army is too dose; it would take them no 
more than a few minutes to fly here from the border to bomb us. We know that 
China and India are at war up in Assam, and it is not just a skirmish. Please con-
sider leaving Rumtek:' 

·You can leave if you want to, but I'm definitely not going; came the reply. 
The Karmapa did not leave and nothing untoward happened. 
As for me, whenever I even broached the subject of my going to Bhutan, the 

Karmapa refused to consider it for even a moment. He simply said, ·From now on, 
you just stay put in Kathmandu and quit moving around!" 



346 IN EXILE 

I've lived in Nepal ever since, where I have been able to survive without any 
threat to life or limb. 

I must admit however that I did try to get to a cave one last time. 
Once, on a visit to Bhutan, I was staying at Paro and, looking up, saw that below 

the famous Taktsang cave was an enticing little hermitage. It wasn't rightfully a 
cave, but it did have a lot of exposure to the sun and appeared to have wonderful 
properties for retreat. 

The Karmapa was also in Bhutan at the time and I pointed out the hermitage to 
him, saying, •I would like to stay up there:' 

To strengthen the point, I reminded him, •The court case in Nepal has been 
settled:' 

·No way; he replied, •oefinitely not! 1 want you in Nepal:' So, once again, my 
plans were thwarted. 

The Karmapa is my refuge and protector in this life as well as in the life to come. 
So how could I live with myself if I kept going against his word?

The Hearing Lineage jron1 
Bomta J(henpo 

My next trip to Bhutan was primarily to meet and receive teachings from an in-
credible master named Bomta Khenpo. I had been yearning deeply to connect 
with him for quite some time and was worried that it might never happen. I had 
met him once at the hermitage Tashi Gang two days journey from the capital and, 
though we spent only an hour together, I was thrilled to the bone by his words. I 
had a strong feeling that if I could just spend a little more time with him, I could 
gain just a tiny bit of understanding. It was mainly due to that one hour together 
that I persisted, finally visiting him in Bhutan. 

He was living at a hermitage in the mountains above the capital, a little wooden 
house provided by his royal benefactor. The queen mother kindly provided for my 
stay, and I moved into a comfortable small hut next to his that had been vacated by 
his bursar, who had gone to India on a pilgrimage. How I cherish the three months 
we were able to spend together! 

If Bomta Khenpo felt close to you, it was very easy to get teachings. "Just come 
early every morning; was all he said, and so every morning I came at the break of 
dawn. There was ample opportunity for him to clarify 
every single point on Dzogchen about which I was not 
clear. 

During this precious time I received Khenpo 
Ngakchung's profound Hearing Lineage from Bomta 
Khenpo. A hearing lineage is one that is given from 
the master's voice to the disciple's ears, and only to one 
person at a time, rather than being a printed text. I re-
ceived the major part of these teachings from Bomta 

Khenpo.'6' 
Many years later I also received parts of the same 

hearing lineage from Nyoshul Khen. However by then 
80. 
Bomta Khenpo

Nyoshul Khen 

Rinpoche 

his voice was so feeble and my hearing 
so weak that we couldn't communicate 
unless we used a hearing aid and ami· 
crophone! Also, I was afraid of disturb-
ing his fragile health and didn't want 
to pursue any of the points too deeply. 
This doesn't mean that Nyoshul Khen 
couldn't transmit that lineage-far 
from it. But he would only give it as a 

one-to-one transmission, with no one in the room but him and me. ' 6 , 
On the other hand, during the months with Bomta Khenpo, my ears had not 

yet gone half deaf, and his voice was bold and strong. Even though we didn't spend 
that much time together, I was able to receive some very solid teachings and ask 
key questions, concerning both personal guidance and the traditional instructions 
on the Great Perfection, from beginning to end. 

Bomta Khenpo was a remarkable master and also very eccentric. ·You and I 
have become very close,· he remarked one clay, ·and you seem able to understand 
what I say. We are now connected as master and disciple.· 

He continued after a pause, ·rm an old man now and I tell you this without 
bragging, but this old man here is a bearer of the authentic Dzogchen teachings. 
Still, what good does that do? No one comes here to request them and even when 
they do, they rarely understand. A lecturer without an audience is no more than a 
barking dog. What's the use of me teaching into the air? 

•No one from Kham, Central Tibet or these southern mountain ranges has 
come to request the view with a sincerity coming from the core of their heart. 
My health is now failing, yet I am still the old bearer of the true Dzogchen teach· 
ings- and it seems that I am going to take them with me when I die:' 

It stung me to hear these moving words, so I requested as many teachings as I 
· could. 

One day Bomta Khenpo told me, ·In my life I have received plenty of teach· 
ings on the view and the scriptures of the Great Perfection, as have many others. 
But I'm one of the rare people who have met both Vimalamitra's emanation and 
Vimalamitra in actuality:'

"Please, Rinpoche; I requested, •tell me the 

. story." 
"Vimalamitra's emanation is my teacher 

Khenpo Ngakchung. Once every hundred years, 
Vimalamitra sends an emanation to Tibet to 
clarify the innermost essence of the Dzogchen 
teachings. Paltrul once told his disciple Lungtok 
ofNyoshul that he didn't get to meet this ema-
nation of Vimalamitra, but 'you will probably 
meet him in your time: Lungtok identified his 
own disciple Khenpo Ngakchung as an unmis-
taken emanation of Vimalamitra and Khenpo 
Ngakchung became my root guru. 

"When I met Khenpo Ngakchung, I already 
had a fairly good comprehension of emptiness, but that degree of theoretical 
learning didn't satisfy me. I still felt an acute need to clarify every point and gain a 
thorough understanding, to the fullest degree. 

"So I asked for the job of Khenpo's tea server- not that I was that young at the 
time, but I thought it would be a good way to get close to the master. Each time 
I poured him a cup of tea, I whispered a short question and each time I received 
an answer. That was the only practical way to approach him; otherwise you had 
to advance to the position of assistant teacher to be allowed to ask questions. for 
eight years, I held on to my menial chore, serving his tea- and at the end of that 
time, I couldn't find a single question that I still needed to ask;" 

Later on, I got a chance to ask the Karmapa about Bomta Khenpo's teacher, 
"\Vhat do you think of Khenpo Ngakchung?" 

"Oh, he's definitely an emanation ofVimalamitra," he replied in his deep voice. 
That settled it. 

"The time I met Vimalamitra in person; Bomta 
Khenpo continued, •1 had gone to stay in a cave up on 
a mountain above Shechen monastery. On the way 
up the mountain, I ran into a beggar-yogi, who volun-
teered to accompany me as an attendant.

tsampa soup. The fire was burning quite nicely and all of a sudden the soup be-
gan to boil over. 

·Quick! Quick!' I anxiously cried out. 'The soup is boiling over!' 
•The beggar turned around, pointed his staff at me, and said, 'Hey, you! Forget 

the soup! You should worry about knowing the wakefulness that is your own na-
ture: 

•At that very moment, I looked toward my mind and, all of a sudden, it was 
more vividly clear than ever before-untainted by even a shred of conceptual 
thinking. For a while I remained suspended in that experience. 

·Hey, you!' the beggar exclaimed. 'The awakened state! That's it!' 
·In the meantime he had rescued the soup, though, and we sat down to lunch. 
·In the afternoon, we walked down the mountain and, as we neared Shechen. 

the beggar told me to walk on ahead. After reaching the monastery, I sat down and 
had a cup of tea. Then I went outside and looked all over the hillside but couldn't 
see anyone in any direction. Then I went all around the entire monastery-but not 
a single person had seen this yogi. Finally, the head lama of Shechen told me, 'You 
won't find that fellow; he's no regular human being: 

•I objected, saying, 'What do you mean he's not a human being? I was with 
him: 

·No, no: the lama declared. 'He was an emanation ofVimalamitra: 
·so I've met such an emanation and he's the one who introduced me to the 

natural state so that I recognized it in actuality-what we call the ineffable natural 
face of awareness. From that point on, my practice became merely a matter of 
training in not being distracted from it-the natural state itself never changed I 
did, however, have to pursue this nondistraction with great perseverance!~o64 

One day, Bomta Khenpo pointed into the air and asked me, ·Do you see these 
Dharma protectorsr 

·No, I don't see anything~ I replied. 
·There she is again! This Dusolma always comes around when you are here. 

Don't you see her? Right there!~ 
·No~ I had to admit. 
•What about all the others?~ he asked, pointing around. 
•I don't see any of them either,~ I said. 
As Bomta Khenpo's moments of ordinary deluded perception became less and 

less frequent, his pure experience increasingly unfolded. Eventually he could see 
all the Dharma protectors as clear as daylight. 



Tlze Hearing Lineage from Bomta Khenpo 351 

He would often give blessings by putting sacred objects on people's heads. Every 
once in a while, he would bang someone really hard and everyone else would run 
;way; then, for a few days no one would come. This banging became known as a 
'wrathful blessing" among the local people. Once I met someone who claimed to have 
rem cured from a serious illness after receiving one of these generous blessings. 

He told me, "Bomta Khenpo hit me so hard I totally forgot my illness and after 
a few days I was all better~ 

While I was there Bomta Khenpo was teaching an important Dzogchen text, 
the Guidance Manual of Unexcelled Wisdom, to a group of eighty or ninety lamas, 
monks and Bhutanese nobles. He gave an amazing exposition of these teachings. 

Then suddenly he exclaimed in a loud voice. "Hey, you, old fellow! You talk and 
talk, but who is there to hear? Why don't you just shut up!" And he slapped himself 
on the cheek. 

For quite a while he just sat there quietly. Then he began teaching, until another 
slap on the cheek interrupted him. And again he would say, "Shut up, old geezer! 
Who is here to understand these teachings?" 

Apparently my own lack of merit meant I couldn't stay to receive the teaching 
in full; I received a message from the Karmapa asking me to come immediately to 
participate in some important ceremonies. So at the end of Bomta Khenpo's lec-
ture that day, I told him that our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel had called for me. 

Bomta Khenpo gave his permission for me to go and then as an aside, men-
tioned, "The expanse of the all-ground has begun to overflow. So many 'untaught 
treatises' now spontaneously manifest from within.:16S If 1 don't watch out, they 
seem to take on a life of their own, pouring out through my mouth. If I'm not care-
ful, I become just a helpless witness. But what's the use of voicing these teachings 
when there is no one here to comprehend? The only thing that seems to help is 
when 1 slap myself on the cheek as a reminder~ 

"How does this happen?" I asked him. 

"I once had a conversation with some old geshe teachers of the highest rank 
from Sera, Ganden and Drepung monasteries; Bomta Khenpo replied. "One of 
them told me, 'I have studied so much and learned so many teachings, but most 
have been forgotten: 

•What?' 1 said. 'Can you forget what you have understood? You mean you for-
get the words, right? Not that you've forgotten the meaning. The tantras mention 
that untaught treatises are supposed to inexhaustibly pour forth spontaneously 
from the adept practitioner. So how can you complain about forgetting?' 



352 IN EXILE 

·sut the old geshe repeated, 'I am forgetting all I have learnt:" 
Bomta Khenpo continued his explanation, ·once you truly understand the 

teachings, it is impossible to forget the meaning, no matter how old you might be. 
My problem is the opposite: there seem to be more teachings than I can possibly 
contain. Sometimes they slip out, so I have to tell this old geezer to shut up and 
slap him until he stays quiet. 

·sut it doesn't help. He just continues talking about how all phenomena are 
interconnected, how the world and all beings are interconnected on both an outer 
and inner level, and how the manifest quality of spontaneous presence is related 
to essence, nature, and capacity. Then the old geezer goes on to how the empty 
essence has a cognizant quality of natural experience that can be either pure or 
impure, unfolding as either the inconceivable wisdom displays or as the prolif-
erations of dualistic mind. Sometimes incredibly detailed explanations come out, 
describing the scenery and the adornments of the world as the illusory city of the 
aggregates, elements and sense-bases.266 Isn't it true that the forests and greenery 
resemble the hairs on our bodies?" 

He went on and on like that. 
He would also cover in incredible detail the properties of the major and rni· 

nor elements that compose the phenomenal world and our human bodies, and 
how they are linked-and then go on to how the sense faculties have a place 
within all this, both in the context of pure wisdom experience and that of the 
deluded way of perceiving samsara. He had an amazing ability to describe the 
basic condition of every human being, in ways I have never encountered on the 
written page. 

Nor have I ever seen any master tell himself to shut up while slapping himself in 
the face-and then stay silent until gradually starting to teach again. 

While our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel was performing the Black Crown ceremony in 
Bhutan, one day Bomta Khenpo came to attend. He had great difficulty walking at 
this point, but he forced himself to walk all the way. 

•I need to meet the one who is Avalokiteshvara in person at least once; he said 
•1 have not yet had the chance to meet him. My background is Sakya, but he is the 
one in whom I have the deepest faith:' 

The Karmapa had traveled there with a large following. At the ceremonies, 
many great tulkus and lamas were seated in the front row, including Shamar, 
Situ, Jamgon and Pawo Rinpoches. I sat in the opposite row with Thrangu 
Rinpoche. · 



Tlze Heari11g Lineage from Bomta Klze11po 353 

At one point, during a break in the 
ceremony, I saw that the Karmapa had 
tears in his eyes. I went over to inquire 
'what the matter might be. 

He leaned toward me so that no one 
else could hear. "In my dreams last night, 
I saw that the king of Bhutan is near the 
end of his life. There is nothing to be 
done. He has been a great benefactor and 
quite close to me, so I feel saddened." 

The Karmapa treated Bomta Khenpo 
with great affection and after the cere-
mony he said to me, "Tell him to stay. l 
would like to have lunch with him." 

After lunch, when Bomta Khenpo had departed, I saw that the Karmapa again 
had tears in his eyes. 

"What's the matter, Rinpoche?" I asked. 
"The merit and life are running out; was all he said. 
The king passed away not long after and it was barely two months before the 

great khenpo left his body as well. For two or three days after the khenpo passed 
away, there wasn't a cloud to be seen in any direction, not even a wisp. '67 

Dudjom Rinpoche later told me that at Bomta Khenpo's funeral, suddenly a 
huge white light was seen coming from his cremation stupa. There were also a 
large number of relic pills found in the ashes. 

Having trekked over to another gompa, I was only aware that someone was be-
ing cremated, but somehow I knew it was this great master. People in the area said 
that they had never seen such a clear sky in their entire lives. Bomta Khenpo was 
an astounding master. 

It was in Bhutan that I asked our Wish-Fulfilling Jewel to give a name to a son 
l had with a girl from Nubri. The next morning he said, "A ngakpa lama named 
Drubwang Tsoknyi appeared to me wearing a white shawl and skirt. Your new son 
is his reincarnation.'"

Conclusion 

At the Karmapa's suggestion, I went to Malaysia with three attendants. Our little 
gang of four robed people were the first Tibetan lamas to visit. The trip lasted 
three months and I was able to accumulate a fair amount of funds from faithful 
Chinese Buddhists there. 

I had decided to use the money to improve the temple at Nagi Gompa. However, 
once I got back to Nepal and started conferring with Ram Lal about how best 
to use the funds, a letter arrived from my two older sons, Chokyi Nyima and 
Chokling. They were finishing up their studies at Rumtek with the Karmapa and 
other great masters. 

The letter said: 

Dear Father and Mother, 
The Karmapa has told us both that we must build a monastery. We are too 
young to do anything about it now, but we have heard that the Chini Lama 
offered you some land at the Great Stupa. Please build a small monastery 
there. It doesn't have to be two stories; one is fine. 

The Karmapa hadn't singled 
out Chokyi Nyima and Chokling 
to build a monastery- he had 
-told the same thing to every 

single tulku and lama at Rumtek 
that year. Anyway, this is how I 
embarked on building Ka-Nying 
Shedrub Ling, the monastery at 
the Boudha Stupa. 



Conclusion 355 

When the building was completed, I 86. (left) 
thought, "The Karmapa is my ultimate The sixteen~

give the Treasury of Kagyu Tantric Teachings." 
· The Karmapa replied, "That is very sweet of you; I will definitely come. You 
have my word. I need to go to India first, but after that I will come to Nepal~ 

He came soon after. He also consecrated the temple and statues at Nagi Gompa. 
He gave the empowerments and then returned to Rumtek. 

So, many years after he directed me to build a monastery in Nepal, I was finally 
able to fulfill my Wish-Fulfilling Jewel's command. 

We have reached the end of most everything of major importance that has 
taken place in my life. I'm sorry my story's a bit dull, but I have don't anything 

impressive. 
I have told you about my family history, where I was born, my childhood in 

eastern Tibet and where I have lived. Even 
though I have been asked many times, I can't 
come up with anything spectacular to relate 
about myself. 

My only important accomplishment is 
that I have been able to pass on a few of the 
transmissions I have received.

the Three Sections empowerments to several important incarnate lamas. In this 
way, the transmission for this teaching and the rest of the New Treasures remains 
unbroken. 

I gave the Three Sections nine times. The first time was to our Wish-Fulfilling 
Jewel at Tsurphu. The second time was to Dudjom Rinpoche in Lhasa. Next was to 
Kangsar Khenpo of the Ngor monastery. Later, in Bhutan, I gave the Three Sections

to the Bhutanese incarnation of Palpung 
Khyentse. The next time I gave it was to 
Depuk Rinpoche at Nagi Gompa and !at· 
er to Khampa Gomchen, a lama who lived 
at our monastery at the Boudha Stupa. 
The seventh time was to the Karmapa's 
regents and many other incarnate lamas 
here at Nagi. Following that I offered this 

transmission to Adeu Rinpoche and Tarthang Tulku. The last time I gave it was to 
Tenga Rinpoche. That sums it up. 

I have told some of the details of how the Three Sections has been transmitted 
and also hinted at how many great masters have shown deep appreciation for this 
teaching, including Dudjom Rinpoche. I also related the interest with which they 
pursued receiving it, such as the fifteenth and sixteenth Karmapas. In fact, these 
great masters had such appreciation for this extraordinary teaching that four of 
them undertook to write the empowerment manual for it.-

Oil go Khyentse gave the New Treasures in our monastery at the Boudha Stupa, 
Ka-Nying Shedrub Ling monastery, because I told him, "My second son has been 
recognized as an incarnation of Chokgyur Lingpa.'69 He is also his descendant, 
and I don't feel I can give the empowerments and all the reading transmissions. An 
important master is required, and I feel there is no one superior to you, Rinpoche. 
So, Rinpoche, please bestow the New Treasures upon my sons:' 

When I made my request for him to give the empowerments, Dilgo Khyentse 
simply replied, "Yes, yes. I will definitely do as you ask:' As was typical for Dilgo 
Khyentse he responded with great kindness and care, and not long after was able 
to complete the transmission-when Dilgo Khyentse said he would do something, 
he always did. There were many tulkus and lamas present. Near the end of the

empowerments, because he was very learned, he wrote a fine text explaining the 
lineages from the treasure revealer through the great Khyentse, Kongtrul and the 
other chief disciples, how they were gathered into Tsewang Norbu and from him 
to Neten Chokling and Dzongsar Khyentse from whom Dilgo Khyentse had re-
ceived the lineage.210 

So we have two main lines of transmission for the New Treasures, one through 
Tsewang Norbu to Samten Gyatso, the other through Tsewang Norbu to Neten 
Chokling, Katok Situ and Dzongsar Khyentse, then to Dilgo Khyentse. Most im-
portant, though, the lineages have now been transmitted and continue to be upheld 
to this very day. 

This has been my feeble attempt to briefly explain the stories of the lineage 
masters. I am seventy-six now, but I haven't performed any remarkable feats. So 
all you have are these stories linking together what I have seen and heard. 

Personally, I have eaten a lot of meals and slept in between. That's my life story 
in short. ·

Afterword 

Let's go back to Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche's grandmother loading up the yaks. \Vhy 
would an old lady go to so much trouble? The journey that she was about to under-
take was a highly daunting one. Traveling in 1919 from Nangchcn in eastern Tibet 
to Lhasa in Central Tibet was arduous. The terrain to be traversed was dangerous, 
with huge rock formations of mammoth heights and steep gorges bordered by 
raging rivers. The weather was unpredictable and harsh. Anything could happen, 
from sudden hailstorms or torrential rains to blinding blizzards. 

This is, of course, not to mention the vast distance that lay ahead of the trav-
eling party. It took a minimum of one month on horses, yaks, and on foot. And 
finally, don't leave out the bandits and murderers who might rob and possibly kill 
them or leave them helpless, without animals or supplies to survive the elements. 

So why undertake such a risky journey? Her mission to bring back her famous 
lama son was not to save him from the distractions of a well-fed clergyman amid 
the wealthy. Her aim was to put him to work codifying and collecting the precious 
teachings of her father. This would ensure the continuation of the body of master-
pieces and the propagation of his rich legacy. 

But it was not merely family pride that made the New Treasures so special and 
important to protect. By now you know that the New Treasures are teachings and 
practices revealed by Chokgyur Lingpa, who was the last of one hundred and eight 
great tertons that Padmasambhava mentioned by name in his Golden Garland 
Chronicles. Chokgyur Lingpa met the Lotus-Born master face to face many times 
and discussed important points directly with him. 

These teachings are Padmasambhava's heart essence, made available to the for-
tunate who want to put an end to samsaric existence and reach liberation and 
enlightenment. This amazing legacy continues to benefit countless beings to this 
very day. 

}amgon Kongtrul had complete faith and confidence in Chokgyur Lingpa's 
termas, and received from him as many empowerments for them as he possibly 
could. In his autobiography, he relates his various meetings with the terton and the 
blessings he received from practicing his sadhanas. The great Kongtrul even acted, 
in his own words, as ·the scribe• for Chokgyur Lingpa on several occasions. Not 
only that, but he collected the terton's most important treasures and placed them 



360 BLAZING SPLENDOR 

in the Treasury of Precious Termas, (Rinchen Terdzo), his mammoth work that 
contains the choicest jewels from the revelations of the one hundred and eight 
major and one thousand minor tertons over a millennium. 

In his unpublished work on Hidden Teachings, Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche ex-
plains the Dharma in general and termas in particular: 

Hidden treasures were first buried in earth or rock and later taken out, 

revealed again. Moreover, hidden treasures can also mean treasur~ mines, 
the powers of the five elements, self-existing in nature. Termas can be 

divided into seven different types. Among all the tertons, only Jamyang 

I<hyentse Wan gpo and Chokgyur Lingpa seem to have had all seven types 
of Dharma treasures. The texts of the terma teachings, such as the earth 

termas-whether the original handwritten manuscript was hidden in the 

form of Tibetan writing or written down in the symbolic script of the da-
kinis-remain completely unharmed by the four elements and cannot be 
destroyed, even if the world were to turn upside down, though they may 
stay concealed for one or two thousand years or more before being re-
vealed by the terton at the appropriate time. 

An authentic treasure teaching is comprised exclusively of the words 

of Guru Rinpoche and is not interpolated by other people's thoughts or 
opinions. It is as if the buddhas had examined what would be of the most 
benefit for the present times. Terma teachings are closely linked to their re-

cipients, just as a master gives guidance closely linked to the mind of a dis-

ciple. In the same way, the Dharma treasures of Guru Rinpoche are closely 
related to the present age, like a direct link from the past to the present. 

Dharma treasures are transmitted directly from Guru Rinpoche to his 
authorized terton, thus the lineage is very short. Therefore, since the ter-
ton's mind is indivisible from Guru Rinpoche's, the transmission of bless-

ings is like meeting Guru Rinpoche in person-there is no difference. It 

is therefore definite that a terton has recognized nondual awareness and 

possesses an eminent level of realization. Moreover, the blessings of the 
lineage transmitted from mind to mind cannot possibly be impaired in 

anyway. 
Because of the tremendous and unimpaired blessings of the lineage 

received from a true terton, even if the practitioner manages to receive 
just a short empowerment, there will be immense blessings, unlike when 

receiving other empowerments. We can find this to be true when we truly 
examine our own experience. 



Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche was born into 
. t_lte family line of Chokgyur Lingpa. His 
grandmother and the early masters who 
helped mold his character were commit-
ted to gathering, practicing, preserving 
and· propagating the termas of Chokgyur 
Lingpa. They exhibited a profound appre-
ciation for them and dedicated their lives 
to maintaining the lineage. Tulku Urgyen 
Rinpoche devoted his life to practicing 
and upholding these teachings as well. 
Many realized masters sought him out to 
receive the empowerments for the New 
Treasures. With utmost enthusiasm and 
commitment, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche 
tilled this need for dissemination. Blazing 
Splendor is a testament to this tradition 
that was one of the focal points of Tulku 
Urgyen Rinpoche's life. 

Even though Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche 
downplayed his own achievements, we 
feel it is appropriate to mention some 
of them briefly here. We will not reveal 
his inner life story and level of realiza-
tion; that is for great masters to do. 
Being as he was a hidden Dzogchen 
yogi like the rest of his family, it was not 
his style to laud himself. We will simply 
give a sketch of some of his accomplish-
ments. 

By the time Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche 

passed away in 1996 at the age of seventy-
six, he had built five major monasteries in 
Nepal and a number of smaller ones, as 
well as establishing centers in Malaysia and 
Denmark, and had planted the seeds for an 
eventual center in the USA. His most im-
portant monasteries are in the Kathmandu

Great Stupa, at the Asura Cave, where 
the Lotus-Born master manifested the 
Mahamudra Vidyadhara level, and at 
the hill behind the Swayambhu Stupa. 
He primarily lived at the Nagi Gompa 
hermitage above the Kathmandu valley. 
Under his care and the ensuing care of 
his sons are over a thousand practitio-

ners, including monks, nuns and laypeople. Of his six sons, four are major incar-
nations: Chokyi Nyima, Tsikey Chokling, Tsoknyi and Mingyur Rinpoches.m His 
grandsons include the reincarnation of Dilgo Khyentse and Phakchok Rinpoche, a 
master from Riwoche monastery. Tulku Urgyen's two other sons are Tenpa Yarpel, 
a close attendant to Tenga Rinpoche, and Urgyen Jigmey, one of Uncle Tersey's 
tulkus. 

Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche gave the transmission of the New Treasures to his sons 
and eldest grandson as well as many other incarnate lamas. He insured that these 
precious teachings were passed on and upheld. He was however most well known 
for his Dzogchen instructions. In 1980, when Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche went to the 
West, he was among the first Tibetan masters to teach the most essential instruc-. 

tions of Dzogchen outside of Tibet. He 
did so at the express direction of the 
sixteenth Karmapa, who instructed 
him "Make the wisdom-sun rise on the 
Western skies." And that is exactly what 
he did. 

He conveyed the Dzogchen teachings 
with a brilliance that was unequalled in 
our times. He was famed for his pro-

found meditative realization and for his concise, lucid, and humorous style with 
which he imparted these essential teachings. His method was "instruction through 
one's own experience~ Using few words, this way of teaching pointed out the nature 
of mind, revealing a natural simplicity of wakefulness that enabled the student to ac-
tually touch the heart of awakened mind. He changed the lives of many practitioners 
who received these teachings, recognized their mind nature and persevered in the 
practice. Until his death, many Buddhist students from the world over found their 
way to Nagi Gompa to receive these vital oral instructions in Dzogchcn directly 
from the mouth of this master. His memoirs provide a glimpse into the influences 
and experiences that shaped the man whose simplicity and humility could attract 
such a cross-section of humanity.

Acknowledgements 

It is with great honor, inspiration and encouragement that .we could offer this 
wonderful book, Blazing Splendor. Tulku Urgyen was an amazing storyteller. I 
first heard many of these stories while he was on a world tour with his eldest 
son, Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche, in 1980-81. More often than not, Tulku Urgyen 
Rinpoche would spice up a lecture on profound topics with a story from his life. 
But, unfortunately, I had no tape recorder. 

In 1981-2 we had the fascinating fortune to hear the story ofChokgyur Lingpa 
and his lineage from Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche, an avid patron of the New 
Treasures. These stories were written down and published as 1he Life ofChokgyur 
Lingpa. He suggested that we ask for more details from Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche 
about his uncles and grandmother. 

After an eye operation in 1983, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche had to convalesce in bed 
for several weeks, lying on his back. His German student, Andreas Kretschmar, 
had the foresight to install a small microphone right above Rinpoche's bed. Then 
we requested him to talk about the main masters in his lineage. When Rinpoche 
began to tell a story, Andreas would immediately press the RECORD button. Most 
of those stories are included in this book. 

Years later, we decided to continue gathering these stories. They had been 
so moving that we wanted to preserve them so that other people might benefit. 
We embarked on this pursuit in 1992 when Rinpoche was supervising the build-
ing of one of his several monasteries in the Kathmandu valley. Marcia, Graham 
Sunstein and I would drive from Boudha to Swayambhu every morning and trek 
up to Ngedon Osel Ling to record many wonderful tales. The quest continued 
when Rinpoche lived at the Asura Cave temple, the following year. Primarily, 
though, we gathered the most material while he stayed at his hermitage Nagi 
Gompa. It seemed that with each story we became increasingly enthused, re-. 
questing more and more augmentation. In the end, we had close to fifty tapes. 
We supplemented these with all the story fragments Marcia had managed to 
glean from Rinpoche's innumerable teachings tapes of seminars, answers to 
questions and private meetings. 

The task of translating those tapes and editing them came much later, after 
Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche's passing in 1996. I translated most of the tapes while

Michael Tweed took dictation. Then began the immense task of weaving the sto-
ries into the single narrative presented here-a task undertaken with incredible 
diligence by Michael Tweed (who additionally monitored all aspects of this work), 
as well as Marcia and myself. Years later my good friend Daniel Goleman helped 
wash and iron this well-tailored narrative, while his wife, the gracious and beauti-
ful Tara Bennett Goleman, lent a keen eye for the final polish. 

We could not have endeavored in this project without many helpful Dharma 
friends and the consistent financial assistance they offered. Our list of benefac-
tors include: Jes Bertelsen and the Center for Growth, Daniel and Tara Goleman, 
George MacDonald, Jean-Marie Adamini, Graham Sunstein, and Richard Gere. 

We would also like to thank Quentin English for Michael Tweed's airfare, Josh 
Baran for marketing advice, James Shaheen at Tricycle for believing in and sup-
porting this book, and Tsewang Dechen, the tulku of Samten Gyatso, who ar-
ranged for us to visit many of the places in Nangchen mentioned. 

We take this opportunity to express gratitude to the all-accomplishing no-
ble incarnation, Sogyal Rinpoche who with amazing generosity has given us 
his beautiful foreword. Once again we wish to show appreciation to the exu-
berance of Daniel Goleman in providing his introduction as one more way to 
offer life to the book. Special mention goes to the different photographers, the 
photo and line drawing donors who are listed on the page for art credits. Final 
thanks goes to Kerry Moran, to our expert copy editor, Tracy Davis and to the 
talented type-setter, Rafael Ortet and our ever keen eyed proof reader, Daniel 
Kaufer. · 

This publication of Blazing Splendor has come to life thanks to this continual 
support and enthusiasm, without which it would have remained a mere aspiration. 
There has been so much joy and heartfelt devotion in working with this material. 
Words cannot express the sense of purpose and love we have experienced while 
walking in Tulku Urgyen's landscape, literally and figuratively. It has been a shower 
of his blessings for sure. We rejoice in our collective achievement and harmony.

Please forgive the inevitable faults we might have made. Accept the result as a 
praise and an offering combined with the heartfelt wish that the pure lineages and 
masters will continue and flourish without any obstacles, that the incarnation of 
Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche be blessed with similar abilities, that all beings may ben-
efit from the Buddha's teachings and that we disciples may assemble with all the 
characters we have met here in the Lotus-Covered Realm of Padmasattva!

Appendix: 
The Lineage of the New Treasures 

Chokgyur Lingpa had four close disciples who were like his own sons, who upheld 
his teachings in eastern Tibet. You could call them the "owners of his termas~ One 
of the four was Deypa Tulku. As an old lama he requested the Three Sections em-
powerment from the Chokling of Tsikey, who then said, "I promised to give this 
to only one person, but we need an empowerment assistant, otherwise we can't 
do it. You are old, and I can't run back and forth to the shrine myself. Who would 
be best as shrine attendant?" He decided on my uncle Sang-Ngak, but they didn't 
manage to get hold of him, as he was staying with Konchok Paldron, at the time. 
When Tsikey Chokling managed to contact him, he said to my uncle, "You must 
be the empowerment assistant," which he then became. While Sang-Ngak was 
helping during the ceremony, he also received it. 

In this way, my uncle received via Tsikey Chokling the lineage from Karmcy 
Khenpo's vision of the wisdom-body of Chokgyur Lingpa. Later on, at Fortress 
Peak, Samten Gyatso first received it from Uncle Sang-Ngak with the remark, 
"You're the one who has Karmey Khenpo's lineage, so you must give it to me!" 
After that, Sam ten Gyatso gave the entire transmission again to Uncle Sang-Ngak, 
to my father and to me. That's how I came to have both lineages. Samten Gyatso 
died soon after. 

So we can see that not all the lineages pass through Tsewang Norbu, but 
Tsewang Norbu possessed all the lineages that he received from Khyentse, 
Kongtrul, Karmey Khenpo, and the learned Rinchen Namgyal. He had everything, 
in its entirety. Later on, Sam ten Gyatso was the one who was in possession of the 
entire transmission, some of which he even received from his mother, Konchok 
Paldron. Samten Gyatso passed all these transmissions on to me. 

Recently, Orgyen Tobgyal told me, "You say you have the entire transmission, 
but there is no record describing it. We need to find some account that gives the 
details of how the teachings were passed down. You say that whatever Tsewang 
Norbu had was passed on to Samten Gyatso. Samten Gyatso told you that you 
now have everything that he had received. That's not precise enough. The details 
of the transmission are important; we need to have a written account. There was 
one list of transmission details at Neten, but it was kind of vague. It simply men-
tions that Neten Chokling received this from Tsewang Norbu. Later on, the next 



Appendix: Tire Lineage of the New Treasure 369 

Neten Chokling, my father, received the lineage from Dzongsar Khyentse. But 
he also doesn't know who Dzongsar Khyentse got it from. m Therefore, you must 
make_clear the way in which your family passed these teachings on. Otherwise, 
people won't feel sure later on:" 

What he said is true, but it is also true that I can't write such an account because 
I don't know all the details. I don't have the slightest doubt that I received every-
thing that Sam ten Gyatso had of the New Treasures. He emphatically told me that 
he had given me all that he had and he had everything in its entirety. I don't know 
any more than that. 

Luckily and by the grace of the Three Jewels, we later got hold of the sixteenth 
Karmapa's record of teachings received belonging to the New Treasures, which his 
regents brought me when they came to receive the New Treasures at Nagi Gompa. 
The Karmapa had instructed his regents to come, saying, ·You must receive the 
New Treasures from Tulku Urgyen~ 

The main one who made the request was the third Kongtrul incarnation, who 
came here twice to ask me personally. On his second visit, I said okay. Anyway, 
the text they brought is a real eye-opener. It tells exactly which of the empower-
ments passed from the treasure revealer to Tsewang Norbu, which went through 
Khyentse or Kongtrul or Karmey Khenpo, and which went through the mas-
ter-scholar Rinchen Namgyal and then to Tsewang Norbu and through him to 
Sam ten Gyatso. Some of the lineages pass through Konchok Paldron before reach-
ing Samten Gyatso, and all the details are found in that text.273 That is the text 
Orgyen Tobgyal was insisting should exist and that I never knew existed before. 
It proved quite helpful that he brought this up, since it encouraged us to get hold 
of the text. 

The same text mentions separately everything I offered the Karmapa. When 
Orgyen Tobgyal came here last time, I showed him this text, and he said, ·Good, 
good! Everything is there: the lineage of every single empowerment, all the way 
back to the dharmakaya buddha Samantabhadra~ From him the lineage passes 
through Garab Dorje and Vajrasattva; other lineages come from the Lotus-Born 
master to King Trisong Deutsen's son, and so forth. Fortunately, now we do have 
the Karmapa's lineage list. 

In the beginning, there was no empowerment manual arranged for the Three 
Sections. The first empowerment manual was begun by the great master Kyungtrul, 
who met Sam ten Gyatso and was given the command to write an arrangement for 
the Three Sections empowerments. Kyungtrul wrote while Samten Gyatso gave the 



370 BLAZING SPLENDOR 

empowerments and they discussed many details. However, because of Kyungtrul's 
broad erudition, when he finished with the first of the three sections, the Mind 
Section, it already filled a whole volume. 

A learned master could still transmit the Three Sections without an empow-
erment manual. Dzongsar Khyentse received the transmission from the second 
Chokling of Neten, who was deeply realized and able to give it without having a 
detailed arrangement as support. Neten Chokling was very unusual, a true siddha. 
Of course, he was also learned, but he didn't put on airs about his scholarship. 
He told Dzongsar Khyentse, •1 can give you the empowerments, but the written 
arrangement for doing so is beyond my abilities. You will have to compose the 
arrangement for how to pass these empowerments on in the future:' This is how 
this draft of that empowerment manual came about: while Neten Chokling was 
giving one empowerment after the other during the day, Dzongsar Khyentse me-
ticulously wrote the empowerment manual at night. 

Dzongsar Khyentse was in such a rush to get the manual done by the following 
morning that he had to abbreviate all the inserted sections, so later it was quite 
difficult to follow when giving the empowerment. An uneducated lama like me 
would find sweat pouring down his neck trying to use it. Luckily, Dilgo Khyentse 
had the time to make a first-class script for people like me, so we don't have to flip 
back and forth between texts. Dzongsar Khycntse's text was used when Samten 
Gyatso passed the Three Sections on to me. 

The manual Dilgo Khyentse wrote was done to fulfill his guru's last words. 
Dzongsar Khyentse wasn't satisfied with the one he had earlier written when 
Neten Chokling transmitted the Three Sections to him, Shechen Rabjam and 
Katok Situ. And anyway that text was eventually lost and so he asked his disciple 
Dilgo Khyentse the last time they spoke, over the radiophone from Sikkim, to 
write a second one. Oil go Khyentse's version is the one that is now included in the 
Treasury of Precious Termas and it is extraordinary. 

Dudjom Rinpoche also wrote an empowerment manual for the Three Sections, 
partly at my request. As I mentioned, when he asked me to give the empowerment 
back in Lhasa, it was very difficult with the arrangement text I had. So I said, ·You 
are so learned and eloquent-it would be wonderful if you could write one:' I also 
asked the Karmapa for permission to ask Dudjom to write it, and he said, •sy all 
means, you must ask him to do so!• tater, in Kalimpong, I asked him again and he 
agreed to slowly write a nice one that is now included in his collected works. 

•An empowerment manual for transmitting the essence of Ati Yoga; Dudjom 
Rinpoche once told me, ·doesn't serve its purpose by giving intricate details 
from the Maha and Anu Yoga perspectives. It should be lucid unto itself, just 



Appendix: The Lineage of the New Treasure 371 

like pure gold studded with emeralds and diamonds. That terma in one volume 
the size of my forearm has brought to the light of day not only the three sections 
of Dzogchen but also the three inner tantras, Maha, Anu and Ati, unified into a 
single intent within Padmasambhava's extraordinary framework. All of this is in 
one single book! Each of the three sections has between twelve and fifteen sets of 
instructions. Other than the Lotus-Born master, who would be able to condense 
all of th:lt into one book the size of my forearm? The quotations inserted from 
the original terma in the manual should be like studding pure gold with emeralds 
and diamonds.· As you may see, Dudjom Rinpoche's own empowerment manual 
dearly reflects his opinion, in its conciseness and brilliance using nothing but the 
Dzogchen perspective itself. 

In this way there were four empowerment manuals for the 11rree Sections, two 
of which survive today. 



Endnotes 

1 Although Buddhism of Tibet possesses a vast array of written literature, it relies heavily 
on oral transmission-the direct imparting of knowledge from master to student in an 
unbroken line of succession spanning centuries. These teachings not only impart words 
and intellectual knowledge, equally important is the direct personal experience conveyed, 
which keeps the transmission alive. According to traditional protocol, the student visits 
the teacher to request instruction on a specific meditation practice, usually bearing gifts 
and a sincere wish to practice the advice. In the case of a lineage holder like Tulku Urgyen 
Rinpoche, he not only practices the teachings he receives but also becomes qualified to 
pass on the same transmission to worthy disciples at a future date. [epk] 

2 Seen from the Khampas' perspective, Tibet is a different country a long journey away to 
the west. To show this distinction we use the name 'Central Tibet: [epk] 

3 As Dzongsar Khyentse, one of my teachers, told me, ·Terma teachings were concealed 
to be revealed at particular periods later in history, and they appear in forms most ap-
propriate to the particular time periods in which they are revealed. Each major terton 
must reveal a minimum of three major thl'ml's: Guru Sadhana, Great Perfection, and 
Avalokiteshvara. In our time, Old Khyentse and Chokling were specifically endowed 
with seven transmissions~ [tur] 

4 The 'four enlightened activities' refer to how a buddha or deity benefits sentient beings: 
pacifying, enriching, magnetizing and subjugating. [epk] 

5 Shakya Shri's biography mentions ·the descendant of Chokgyur Lingpa, Tersey Tulku" 
among the disciples who practiced Dzogchen. [tur] 

6 My uncle, Samten Gyatso, encouraged the second Tsikey Chokling to compile a life 
story of Chokgyur Lingpa. This Chokling Tulku was extremely learned and well-spoken 
and embellished many statements with quotations from the old scriptures. But the end 
product didn't completely please Samten Gyatso; instead, Tsikey Chokling got rebuked 
for neglecting to consult Konchok Paldron and merely condensing a previous life story 
elaborately written by Karmey Khenpo. Samten Gyatso said, ·The real story you can 
hear from my mother~ We have another version by Neten Chokling in addition to the 
shorter version by Old Khyentse and Kongtrul, which is based on the Supplication to 
the Life Story of the great terton. [tur] 

7 A detailed story about this stupa is presented in The Legend of the Great Stupa, translat-
ed by Tulku Perna Wangyal and Keith Dowman (Berkeley: Dharma Publishing, 2003). 

8 Vimalamitra's life can be found in Tulku Thondup, Masters of Meditation and Mirades, 
and Vairotsana's detailed biography is available in English as The Great Image, translated 
by Ani Jinpa Palmo, both from Shambhala Publications. 

9 All together, eight transmission lineages flourished in Tibet and were later known as 
the Eight Chariots of the Practice Lineage. One was Nyingma, literally the Old SchooL 
and the others Sarma, or New Schools, which include the Marpa Kagyii, the Shangpa 



E11dnotes 373 

Kagyii, and the Lamdrey (Path and Fruit), which belonged to the Sakya tradition. There 
was also the I<adampa, later reformed into the Gelug school, as well as the Shijey and 
Cho, which respectively mean Pacifying and Cutting. The Jordruk, or Six Unions, and 
the Nyendrub, or Three Vajra Practices of Approach and Accomplishment, likewise ap-
peared among the many practice lineages in Tibet. [tur] 

10 Tibetan historians sometimes write that India is like the father of the Buddha's teach-
Ings, Nepal is like the mother, and the teachings that arrived in Tibet were like their 
offlipring. [tur] 

11 The earliest mention of the Tsangsar family Is by Ga Lotsawa, a great translator who 
visited India, as well as being a great siddha. Another reference is found in the tale of 
King Gesar of Ling, whose guru was also a member of the Tsangsar family. [tur] 

12 The beginning of the Kagyii lineages is described as the Four Greater and the Eight 
Lesser schools. Each of these appears to have its own individual way of continuing the 
lineage: one from uncle to nephew, one through "bone line~ which means father to son, 
and one where guru and disciple are both monks. The Barom Kagyil was continued 
through both hereditary and monk lineage, and my ancestors trace their origin back to 
the masters of this lineage. [tur] 

For more details about the various Kagyillineages, see The Rain of Wudom, trans-
lated by Nalanda Translation Committee (Boston: Shambhala Publications, 1989), and 
Tsang Nyon Heruka, The Ufe of Marpa the Translator (Boston: Shambhala Publications, 
1995). [epk] 

13 According to the profound system of the Buddhist tantras, each experience-whether 
profane or sublime-has an inner correlation in the structure of the subtle channels, 
energies and essences. [epk] 

14 Gampopa became known as World-Renowned master from Dakpo (Dakpo Dzamling 
Drakpa), hence the lineage known as the Dakpo Kagyil. Phadru Dorje Gyalpo, one of 
Gampopa's chief disciples, was an Incredibly realized master. His mind was as open as 
the sky. Each of his disciples gave rise to an individual lineage known as the eight lesser 
Kagyil schools. Phadru died when leprosy swept through the region; in order to save the 
others, he took everyone's disease upon himself and hence passed away. While carrying 
his body toward the funeral pyre, they set it down for a moment on a large rock. The 
body sank into the ·rock, and when they lifted it out a very clear imprint was left behind. 
The great master Sakya Pandita heard this story and wrote in a teasing manner, which 
is actually a concealed form of praise, •The footprints made from Phadru's corpse were 
definitely needed, but they were too late: He meant that it would be more appropriate 
to leave footprints when one is still alive. [tur] 

15 This Barom Gompa, known as the Upper Seat, was at Sangzhung, situated in the Nakchu 
province northeast of Lhasa. [tur} 

16 To this day, Nangchen is still known as Gomde. Local balladeers have even composed a 
beautiful song explaining how this land of meditators is a true homeland. [mbs] 

17 People could even find relic pills-a sign of extremely high spiritual attainment-in his 
urine and excrement. The first Karmapa, Dusum Khyenpa-who was one of Phadru's 
Dharma brothers-practiced for many years under a simple rock overhang where he 
built a simple stone wall. At some point, people found that tiny relic pills known as ring-
sel, relic pills, were appearing in his feces. Sakya Pandita wrote, •The ringsel in Dusum's 



374 BLAZING SPLENDOR 

shit were definitely needed, but they came too soon• -meaning they should have been 
found in his remains after he died. It is said that even many centuries later, people were 
still finding them at the same spot. [tur) 

11 TlShi Repa is known to have said, •oarma Wangchuk introduced me to the unmistaken 
state of natural mind. Lama Shang Tsalpa introduced me to boundless interconnected· 
ness. Kyobpa Jigten Sumgon taught me unceasing devotion. Taklung ensured that I could 
forsake all worldly concerns, regarding them as nothing more than ashes, so that I could 
never forget it:' In this way, the four outer peaks symbolized his own teachers. [tur) 

19 This story of Chogyal Pakpa's visit to China exemplifies the traditional relationship be-
tween Tibet and China as accepted by most Tibetans, called •master and benefactor." 
[mbs] 

Chogyal Pakpa was invited to China, where he became the guru of the Mongol em· 
peror. Together they became renowned everywhere by the saying ·In the sky are the sun 
and the moon; on the earth are the guru and patron:' Chogyal Pakpa was Sakya Pandita's 
nephew, and it is interesting to note that Sakya Pandita once had a vision of the female 
deity Kurukulle, the Lotus Dakini, in which she told him, ·The time for my serving you 
will not appear during your life, but I will accomplish your nephew's every wish.• 

The second Karmapa, Karma Pakshi, accompanied Chogyal Pakpa to China. During 
their journey, war broke out in the kingdom of Ling, and it became very difficult to 
proceed. To avoid the turmoil, the caravan turned south and went through lower I<ham, 
where they stopped at the first Nyingma monastery in the area, the Vajra Throne of 
Katok. The visiting lamas were requested to perform a consecration of the new Buddha 
statue. While Chogyal Pakpa chanted his benediction, Karma Pakshi literally turned the 
temple inside-out in a single moment. A third accomplished master who was there said, 
·we can't leave it like this!• and proceeded to put the temple back to normal. 

Chogyal Pakpa and Karma Pakshi then proceeded to China, where the story goes 
that Karma Pakshi performed one incredible miracle after another. One day, the queen 
said to ChOgyal Pakpa, •It is fine that you let your disciple perform miracles, but the 
emperor is beginning to prefer him to you. Until now, you haven't displayed any special 
signs, so if you have some sign of accomplishment to show, you better do so soon." 
When the emperor arrived the next morning Chogyal Pakpa cut off his own head and 
left it hovering in midair above his still-seated body. In despair, the emperor cried out, 
•My lama has died! My lama has died!• and prostrated in front of Chogyal Pakpa. Finally 
Chogyal Pakpa let his head descend back to its original position and declared. •The 
ultimate truth is beyond birth and death:' After he witnessed this, the emperor's trust 
in Chogyal Pakpa became unshakable. Chogyal Pakpa and Karma Pakshi then received 
the highest honors as religious dignitaries-ChOgyal Pakpa as the supreme and Karma 
Pakshi one rank below. 

During empowerment ceremonies, the previous emperors had received the bless· 
ings from the empowerment vase and other implements on their thumb rather than 
on the crown of their head. Chogyal Pakpa had begun to do likewil>e so that the em· 
peror, who was not in the habit of bowing to anyone, simply remained seated with 
his head held high while Chogyal Pakpa raised the empowerment vase. Karma Pakshl. 
however, had a siddha·type personality and tolerated no nonsense, and so one time he 
said, ·Empowerments and rivers do not flow uphill; you need to bow your head!• and 
physically ·helped• the emperor bow his head, which was a cause for severe punishment 



Enduotes 375 

to be meted out. If you read the supplication to Karma Pakshi, you will see the list of 
these punishments and the miracle he performed in response to each. No matter what 
his torturers tried, they were unable to execute him, and the imperial court fmally gave 
up on trying to execute him. There is also a story about how Karma Pakshi transported 
a gift of a copper roof to Tsurphu by throwing it in the river in China and picking it up 
in Central Tibet. [tur] 

» Marpa's disciple Ngog Choku Dorje (1036-1106) became the student foremost in mas-
tering the explanations of the Tantras. Thrangu Rinpoche is regarded to be a reincarna-
tion of this master. [epk] 

n This lama was Geshe Chayulwa (1075-1138}, a master in the old Kadam tradition which 
emphasizes mind training (lojong}, the Mahayana way of developing the awakened at-
titude of a bodhisattva by treasuring others higher than oneself. [epk] 

n With 'half-wisdom and half-mundane' he means a guardian of the Dharma who appears 
in a form that is not completely enlightened. Dharma protectors are often nonhuman 
spirits who vow to protect and guard the teachings of the Buddha and its followers. 
They can be either 'mundane' I.e. virtuous samsaric beings or 'wisdom protectors' who 
are emanations of buddhas or bodhisattvas. [epk] 

zs Lumey Dorje moved into the Nangso Chenmo palace that Repa Karpo modeled after 
the Jokhang in Utasa. [tur] 

24 Over the centuries, the heads of the monasteries in Nangchen became followers of 
the Drigung Kagyii lineage, and in recent times the king's gurus were from the Drukpa 
Kagyi.i school. The king's main temple, Tsechu Gompa, is Drukpa Kagyil; the head lama 
of this monastery is Adeu Rinpoche. Several of the other major monasteries are Drigung 
Kagyi.i. [ tur] 

25 These included Kyodrak, Surmang, etc. [tur] 
26 Three brothers were born in the Tsangsar lineage: Ngaktrin, Sonam Yeshe, and Namgyal 

Tulku. Sonam Yeshe was nicknamed ·the bird voice of Tsangsar; for not only did he 
sound like a bird, but he twisted his head in an unusual way. All three grew up to be-
come lamas, and each built a monastery. Ngaktrin founded Lachab Gompa, Sonam 
Yeshe founded what is now known as Tsangsar Gompa, and Namgyal Tulku founded 
Demo Gompa. [tur] 

rJ Every one ofTulku Urgyen Rinpoche's ancestors left ringsel (relic pills) after the crema-
tion pyre was opened, including Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche. [epk] 

21 I would also like to mention Utasung, one of the most important masters among my 
ancestors. He was one of five brothers who all became siddhas and he manifested a rain-
bow body at the end of his life. This happened during the lives of the great child terton 
NamchO Mingyur Dorje and his disciple Karma Chagmey. Mingyur Dorje received a 
mind treasure, thirty-seven folios long, concerning Utasung, which included a sadhana 
as well as other practices involving the various activities of enlightenment. In his vi-
sion, the young Mingyur Dorje saw that Utasung had emanated from the navel center 
of Mahakala, the guardian of the Buddha's teachings. The terton gave the scripture to 
Utasung's disciples and told them, ·uyou can perform these practices, it will ensure the 
protection of your lineage for many generations~ I have some of the hairs Utasung left 
behind after his body vanished into rainbow light, which I put into one of my amulet 
boxes. [tur)

30 Mahakala is the main Dharma protector of the male class, while Dusolma is the main 
female, and there is one other important deity called Shinje Trochu. These Dharma

and tantras passed on in an unbroken line from master to disciple; 2.) earth treasure, 
revealed by the terton; 3) rediscovered treasure. revealed for the second time from a 
past treasure; 4) mind treasure, revealed from the mind of the guru; s) hearing lineage, 
received directly from an enlightened being; 6) pure vision, received in a pure experi-
ence; and 7) recollection, remembrance from a former life. [epk) 

,. The first two terton masters, Nyang-Ral and Guru Chowang. were known as the Two 
Terton Kings, and the other hundred tertons are described as their attendants. There 
are also the Three Eminent Tertons, the Eight Llngpas, the twenty-five major tertons, 
and so forth, all of equal importance. But among the 108 tertons, the main ones are 
the outstanding Two Terton Kings: Nyang-Ral Nyima Ozer and Guru Chowang. The 
first among all tertons was known as Sangye Lama, who, by the way, is not the same as 
Sangye Lingpa. [tur] 

35 You can find the details of his remarkable change in his extensive biography (VoL 38 of 
New Treasures). [Tur) 

36 During a vision of Padmasambhava, Chokgyur Lingpa received this advice, which is 
included in the famous Ngakso text, which is based on the terma treasure Tukdrub 
Barchey Kunsel: ·During this part of the dark age there is almost no Tibetan who hasn't 
received an empowerment for Vajrayana. The sacred samaya bond is what sustains the 
life-force of empowerment. Without observing the samayas, the life-force of the em-
powerment vanishes, like a feather blown away in the wind, and will not bring you any 
benefit." For this reason Chokgyur Lingpa requested a method for regularly restoring 
the samayas, the tantric commitments, which he then received, based on the Tukdrub 
Barchey Kunsel teachings. This practice is now widely known as the Ngakso. [tur)

type of guardian is known as yingkyi kasung, •guardian of the dharmadhatu teaching~

Dorie Lekpa. There arc also guardians who are half wisdom beings and half mundane,

55 Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo ·revived• some of these precious teachings in the manner 
of 'rediscovered treasures: by writing them down again, conferring the empowerments 
and explaining the teachings. Due to his outstanding realization and being a terton, he 
had access to all the termas of former treasure revealers and could write them down at 
will. Kongtrul included most of these rediscovered treasures (yangter) in the Treasury 
of Precious Termas. (epk]

57 The need for terton to have a consort in order to •unlock the treasure chest• of the 
termas has to do with a profound connection between consort practice and realization. 
A terma is essentially concealed within an ·indestructible sphere• In the terton's heart 
center-indelibly sealed in his stream of being when in a past incarnation he received 
the transmission from Padmasambhava In person-and an extraordinary yogic practice 
Is now necessary to bring it forth. The failure to do so can often incur the wrath of the 
dakinis in that he neglects a past pledge to benefit sentient beings. [epk) 

51 Zilnon Namkhai Dorje was one of the main teachers of Dudjom Rinpoche. This terton 
appeared shortly before the fifteenth Karmapa and Is regarded as authentic. His tennas 
include some prophecies about the future. [tur) 

59 When referred to respectfully, her full name was Urgyen Tsomo, the Great Dakini of 
Tsurphu (Tsurphu Khandro Chenmo Urgyen Tsomo), as she was born in a valley be-
hind Tsurphu. [tur) 

"' This was the hermitage of the first Kongtrul. It was called Tsari-like Jewel Rock (Tsadra 
Rinchen Drak). [epk) 

61 This way of speaking shows Samten Gyatso's deep respect for the Karmapa. The same 
wording would be used for making offerings to the buddhas and bodhisattvas. Tulku 
Urgyen Rinpoche also mentions that his guru had commented on this: •1n the past, 
I couldn't refuse the second Kongtrul, so how can I refuse the Karmapa? Moreover, if 
Khakyab Dorje doesn't receive the New Treasures, its continuation will be in danger in 
the future, so I must consent:' [epk) 

62 Karmey Khenpo's collected works contain innumerable answers from Chokgyur Ungpa 
on various topics and practices. [epk)

M In this way, Tsikey Chokling received two lineages: one from Tsewang Norbu and the 
other from Karmey Khenpo. Jamgon Kongtrul never received the Three Sections of the 
Great Perfection from Chokgyur Lingpa either, but had to wait until Khyentse gave it to 
him. [tur) 

65 Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche told Erik and I the following story he heard from his grand-
mother, which unfortunately, we did not tape. Konchok Paldron was at an encampment 
with both Karmey Khenpo and the first Tsoknyl. One day they were debating and of 
course Tsoknyl could not defeat the Khenpo. At one point Tsoknyl shouted, •1 don't 
care what you say about emptiness; when you realize it, it's like this!• Then he flew over 
Chokgyur Lingpa's tent. Konchok Paldron told her mother who was inside another tent 
that Tsoknyi had just flown in the sky. Lady Degah responded by saying, ·oh, that is 
merely Tsoknyl showing off again.• Moreover, the yogi-master did not impress Karmey 
Khenpo either, but got scolded for being disrespectful by flying over the great terton's 
tent. [mbs) 

66 It Is often the case that the ~one-line• from a great revealer of terma treasures is re-
garded as having special blessings, perhaps encoded with the DNA. Cutting the hair 
implies becoming a monk and having no offspring and consequently no direct lineage-
holders in the family line. [epk) 

67 This remark meant that Wangchok Dorje had the ability to establish in writing the ter-

mas that Chokgyur Lingpa had missed. [tur] There were quite a few still waiting to be 
r~vealcd. [cpk] 

61 There were also copies at Tsikey and Neten, the monasteries of the other incarnations 
of Chokgyur Lingpa. Dzongsar Khyentse, in western Kham, had a huge library that 
contained copies as well. Tsoknyi's monastery Gebchak also had a large library, but it, as 
wer«: the other libraries, was burned down by the communists. [tur] 

69 Since this. time, Chokgyur Lingpa's writings have been found and comprise the final two 
volumes of Lama Putse's edition of the New Treasures ( Chokling Tersar). [epk]. 

10 The one Chokgyur Lingpa had taken as his consort, as was necessary for revealing the 
terma for the Three Sections of the Great Perfection. [tur] 

71 When the great translator Vairotsana had been exiled to an eastern region in Kham, he 
met a vassal king's son named Yudra Nyingpo. Amazingly, it is said that his realization 
was perfected simply upon seeing Vairotsana. [tur] 

71 The Three Sections of the Great Perfection are also sometimes known as Vairotsana 
Dzogchen or Heart Essence of Vairotsana (Vairo Nyingtig). The Vairo Nyingtig should 
therefore first be conferred to an incarnation of Yudra Nyingpo, and such an incarna-
tion appeared as Chokgyur Lingpa's own son. Chokgyur Lingpa revealed this terma in 
the presence of both Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and Jamgon Kongtrul and immedi-
ately conferred the empowerment of Three Sections upon Jamyang Khyentse and Yudra 
Nyingpo; the latter was only about six months old at the time. This is why Tsewang 
Norbu is regarded as an emanation ofYudra Nyingpo. [tur) 

73 According to the biography of Jamgon Kongtrul, this was on the third day of the twelfth 
month of the fire dragon year (1857), which puts Tsewang Norbu's birth in 1856, six 
months prior. [mbs] 

74 Being a disciple of Paltrul Rinpoche, Tsewang Norbu originally followed Longchen 
Nyingtig. This was true of both brothers; due to a connection from former lives, they 
had immense devotion for Paltrul. Later, he only practiced the termas of Chokgyur 
Lingpa, to such an extent that near the end of his life he embodied the very life force of 
the New Treasures in terms of continuing the empowerments, reading transmissions, 
and instructions. One reason was the early demise of his brother, who had never been 
able to pass the lineage on in any significant way. When you look at the lineage records, 
you find Tsewang Norbu's name in almost all of them. Above him are only Chokgyur 
Lingpa. Jamyang Khyentse, or Jamgon Kongtrul. Since the great terton died in his for-
ties, Tsewang Norbu didn't receive much of the lineage directly from his father, but he 
did get the Three Sections, as we know. [tur] 

75 Mastery in yoga, including full control over subtle channels and energies, includes the 
ability to extract essence from air and space, enough to keep the body alive for a long 
time. [epk] 

76 Throughout all of Tibet the Karma pas was regarded not as an ordinary man but as a 
living buddha, hence Tsewang Norbu's reluctance to give an empowerment to someone 
of such stature. [epk] 

77 A prediction had been contained in a terma from the Lotus-Born master indicating that 
the family line of Mindrolling would be maintained by a descendant of Chokgyur Lingpa. 
As Tsewang Norbu explained, ·old Khyentse knew that the family line at Mind rolling 

379 



380 BLAZING SPLENDOR 

was in danger of being interrupted. But he had revealed a prophecy that the daughter 
of the Mindrolling family was destined to marry a son of Chokgyur Lingpa. Even so, he 
simply sent me off without telling me any of that.• Since the bone line has been broken. 
today the family lineage of Mindrolling is considered a blood line, carried on through 
the chieflama's daughter. [tur] 

71 This could be the time when the thirteenth Dalai Lama had fled to India in 1909, after a 
Chinese invasion. There was a Tibetan uprising, and by April, 1912, the Chinese troops 
surrendered and were permitted to leave Tibet via India. The Dalai Lama returned to 
Lhasa in January 1913. See Melvyn Goldstein, A History of Modern Tibet 1913-1951: 7he 
Demise of the Lamaist State (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), pp. 54-59.

79 This would have been the drubchen entitled Gongpa Kundu. [epk] 
80 The Kechu is quite wide near its confluence with the Tsichu River, which, by the way, is 

where Tsikey gets its name. [tur] 
11 Tsewang Norbu was not only Chokgyur Lingpa's son but also Khyentse's nephew. 

[epk] 
12 She was adept in the Mindrolling style of tangka painting from Central Tibet, which is 

distinct from the Karma Gardri style of the east. [tur] 
13 Khyentse's main residence in Derge was at Dzongsho. The drubchen performed was 

Gongpa Kundu. [epk] 
14 Sometimes a tulku may be regarded as an emanation of a past master. sometimes of a 

deity. The Dalai Lamas, for instance, are said to be emanations of Avalokiteshvara. Four-
Armed Mahakala is a wrathful form of Avalokiteshvara. [epk] 

15 The first Ngawang Trinley was one of the three Tsangsar brothers who became known 
as the •three wish-fulfilling sons.· In his succeeding lives, Ngawang Trinley's incarnation 
was known as Ngaktrin, the abbreviated form of the name, together with where he was 
born, thus Argong Ngaktrin, Chiltsa Ngaktrin and Tsangsar Ngaktrin. [tur] 

16 These included Rinchen Namgyal. Khewang Chogyal and Son tar Chonchok, who was 
one of his close Dharma friends and an extraordinary Dzogchen master. [tur] 

17 Kyasu being Chokgyur Lingpa's family name. [tur] 
11 The practice of phowa, the ejection of consciousness, is a skillful way of making sure 

that one takes rebirth in a buddhafield, or at least in one of the higher realms, and is 
performed right at the moment of death. This is necessary because we human beings 
are usually lazy and busy ourselves with futile pursuits so that our precious life is over 
far too soon. [epk] 

19 Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche recently received one of those handwritten manuscripts and 
has it in his possession in Boudhanath, Nepal. [epk] 

90 When you look back through the history of who succeeded in transmitting Chokgyur 
Lingpa's New Treasures for future generations, It is obvious that Tsewang Norbu spoke 
from his clairvoyant point of view when he singled out Samten Gyatso at Riwoche. 
During his life, Samten Gyatso had taken upon himself the task of meticulously tracking 
down every single text, empowerment, and reading transmission and collected them 
all within himself. This was no small feat if you consider the geography of Kham and 



End11otes 381 

how far-flung the people possessing the texts and lineages were. It is largely thanks 
to Samten Gyatso that we now have such an extensive version of not only Chokgyur 
Llngpa's terma treasures but also all the additional teachings related to them. Moreover, 
on his visit to Central Tibet, he personally requested Khakyab Dorje to compose any 
additional arrangements that were still required, while he himself was offering empow-
erments to the Karmapa. You can find out how many when you look through the index 
to the New Treasures. It Is a Tibetan tradition that the author always mentions in the 
colophon the name of the person who requested the writing, and in the index you find 
Samten Gyatso's name more than a few times. It is such a kindness that someone took 
so much trouble for future generations. [tur) 

" After this, Tsewang Norbu went to Central Tibet, while Samten Gyatso remained in 
Kham. When Samten Gyatso went to Central Tibet with his mother two years later, 
Tsewang Norbu had already passed away. [tur) 

92 Outwardly, he was a virtuous monk strictly adhering to the monastic precepts: inward-
ly, he adhered to the bodhisattva trainings: and on the innermost level, he adhered to 
the commitments ofVajrayana. [tur) 

93 Karmey Khenpo had been reborn as the son of Samten Gyatso's sister. [tur) 
,. Nang Tsangsar Gompa had been founded by my father's previous incarnation, Tsangsar 

Sonam Yeshe, who was believed to be an emanation of the Crow-Headed Protector

95 Dzigar Kongtrul had one of Lady Degah's bones that had an image of the female buddha 
Tara on it He kept this relic In a small sandalwood box. I saw it with my own eyes, and 
it was definitely not a fake. He kept many bones from great lamas as his secret shrine 
objects. [tur) 

96 Tsikey Chokling is her father's current incarnation at Tsikey monastery. [epk) 

"' These four periods here are explained as the age of bringing practice to fruition, simply

91 As a boy, 1 attended him just as a servant would. For two years, I managed his house-
hold: before that, I was his cook and sometimes made him the special momo dumplings. 
I never even heard him scold a servant. He never once spanked me-but then I never 
went against his wishes. [tur) 

With 'transference of realization' is meant that Chimey Dorje realized the basic state 
of wakefulness that is unchanging and identical with that of his teacher. [epk) 

99 For these four, see 'four levels of Dzogchen and Mahamudra' in the Glossary. {epk) 
100 Even a hidden yogi caMot prevent special signs from manifesting at the time of death. 

Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche once said that •A practitioner shouldn't show off except at the 
time of death, when best is to laugh, next best to be unafraid and third best is to have 
no regrets:' "I he body shrinking is considered a lesser version of the •rainbow body• and 
Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche sometimes said that disciple's were known to hasten the crema-
tion of their master to •at least retain some tangible relics:' The ringsel-tiny, shiny pearl-
like pills-can often be found in the ashes. The ancient Dzogchen tantras describe the 
various types, colors and reasons why they appear as signs of inner realization. [epk) 

101 One of the eight main traditions in Tibetan Buddhism, Cho is the tradition of letting go. 
Cho practice is done to relinquish selfishness and is an eminent method for abandoning 



382 BLAZING SPLENDOR 

attachment, to be free. Cutting, the meaning of Chii, refers to cutting through subject· 
object fixation, cutting through dualistic experience. This Cho teaching was the only 
one that was translated from Ttbetan into the Indian languages-showing how special 
it is. Cho is practiced out of the unity of emptiness and compassion. In this coura-
geous compassion there is no hesitation, no doubt in acting for the welfare of beings. As 
Machik Labdron said, ·compared to begging one hundred times, 'Save me, protect me~ 
it is much more effective to say once, 'Devour me!'· [tur] 

Cho is the instruction in giving away the 'body of illusion' as a feast offering, the 
reason being that we human beings have strong attachment to the material body. For 
detailed teachings on Cho practice, see Machik's Complete Explanation, Clarifying the 
Meaning of Chad. (Sarah Harding, trans.) Snowlion Publications, Ithaca, NY, 2003. 
[epk] 

102 Sarah Harding calls these the four devils of the material, the immaterial, of exaltation & 
inflation, where inflation is defined as ego-fixation, pgs. 117·120 in Machik's Complete 
Explanation. Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche explains indecision as the subtle wavering of con· 
sciousness due to ignorance which then necessitates latching on to a solid sense of self 
and world, which is ego-fixation. [epk] 

103 A rebirth of a lama from the old Sertsa monastery in the Gegyal Riwo district. [tur] 
104 Uncle had received Karmey Khenpo's lineage for these empowerments from the Tsikey 

of Chokling while Samten Gyatso received his from Tsewang Norbu. These were re· 
garded as two different streams of blessings in that Tsewang Norbu received it from 
his father, the great terton, in person, while Karmey Khenpo received his from the 
Chokgyur Lingpa's wisdom body, after the terton had passed away. [epk] 

105 I believe Uncle Tersey was about sixty-six years old when he died, as he died during my 
second visit to Central Tibet. [tur) 

106 The height of a lama's throne is often a measure of his rank or stature, either political or 
spiritual. [epk] 

107 The retreat center above Tsikey was called Mindrolling, the •sanctuary of Ripening and 
Liberation~ The lamas at Riwoche monastery had great trust in my Uncle Tersey and so 
invited him there to give teachings. And after Samten Gyatso passed away, Tersey was 
invited to Fortress Peak to give teachings. [tur) 

Uncle Tersey later did have offspring. His granddaughter, a nun, was recently attending 
the Chokling tulku at Tsikey monastery. [epk) 

108 The integrity consists in not wanting to distract people away from what is more impor· 
tant than miracles-renunciation, compassion and the true view. [epk) 

109 A great meditator who realizes the awakened state to such an extent Samten Gyatso 
mentions has no basis whatsoever of falling back into samsara. The reason is, as Tulku 
Urgyen Rinpoche taught, •stability in nondual wakefulness is free of the ignorance re-
quired to take rebirth~ (epk] 

110 Uncle Tersey had no interest in the respect and social status arising from giving em· 
powerments to exalted masters like the Karmapa. [epk] 

m An empowerment can be given as a ceremony of conferring blessings on a practitioner 
who is then authorized to begin a particular sadhana. It can also be given in the real 
sense of authorizing the disciple through introducing the nature of reality, which essen·

but who knows-it may still surface in Kham. He wrote the Side Ornament for the 
Heart Essence ofSamantabhadra and many similar texts that are included in the New 
Treasures. [tur) 

A terma treasure is often very concise and contains many implied references, which 
are obvious to a master or lineage holder. For ordinary practitioners to use in their 
daily sadhana practice it Is necessary to have the obvious spelled out, the implications 
explained and the references inserted. [epk) 

113 This is how the particular type of statue known as jema atrong was made. Chokgyur 
Lingpa once gave one such statue to the king of Nangchen. Several people, including 
Dilgo Khyentse, have one of these. [tur)

Tersey told me that at Shakya Shri's hermitage, Uncle Tersey himself and Drukpa 
Yongdzin, below the Drukchen Jamgon, were among the chief disciples. Shakya Shri 
practiced the Heart Essenu of Samantabhadra, though he had never met Chokgyur

126 This included the complete transmission for Tukdrub Barchey Kunsel, at the request 
of Tubwang Rinpoche, who was Lama Tendzin Dorje's brother. Bong Gompa had 
three main lamas. Gampo Tulku, an incarnation of Gampopa whose residence was at 
Gampopa's original seat, also attended this transmission. He had deep appreciation for 
the New Treasures of Chokgyur Lingpa, and even though he didn't receive them all, he 
wanted at least the Tukdrub empowerments that Samten Gyatso gave. [tur]

132 On a visit in 2003 to this nunnery, which is once again home to many fine female practi-
tioners, we saw that the juniper trees have grown back. There is now a rule that not one 
single branch is allowed to be cut from any of these beautiful trees, although the needles 
may be collected for the preparation of a sacred incense. [mbs] 

133 And rebuilt finely indeed by the many nuns living there! Dechen Ling faces south to-
wards a beautiful valley. There is plenty of sunshine, water and trees. When we visited

136 Tsoknyi had access to several mind treasures, one of which was very similar to one 

of Chokgyur Lingpa's termas for realizing the dharmakaya aspect of the guru. When 
Chokgyur Lingpa saw it, he told Tsoknyi teasingly, ·You stole my terma!• then laughed. 
The first Tsoknyi was a master with that kind of capacity. [tur] 

137 This is different from a drubdra or sadhana retreat. Prior to entering a gomdra medita-
tion retreat the practitioner would usually have gone through one or several sadhana 
retreats, covering the preliminaries, yidam practice and the inner yogas. The practice 
now would focus on the unelaborate training in the four yogas of Mahamudra or on 
Trekcho and Toga!. [epk)

155 ·Remaining absentminded and unaware in the state of the all-ground· means that the 
meditator has decided to simply rest in a peaceful and serene state of mind while ignor-
ing not only the mindful presence of shamatha and vipashyana, but also the knowing of 
the unformed natural state that defies every concept. [epk) 

156 The instructions in being liberated during the bardo states are necessary since we hu-
man beings too often create causes that develop the phenomena of the lower realms-
out of hatred, greed and uncaring apathy. [epk) 

157 Although, in essence, the natural state is identical with the mind of a fully awakened 
buddha, for most people the experience of the natural state passes by like a flash of 
lightning in the sky. A buddha, on the other hand, has attained complete stability in 
the natural state. The training to attain stability requires instructions from a qualified 
master. [epk] 

158 Tana is the seat of the Yerpa Kagyii, one of the original schools of the Kagyii lineage. The

159 We are assuming that Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche refers to the 1936 intrusion by the com-
munist forces, who were chased by the nationalists into eastern Tibet as noted earliu 
[mbs] 

160 In addition to Situ and Khyentse of Palpung, two other masters-Karsey Kongtrul and 
Ongtrul-had their own sections of the monastery which they personally supervised. 
[tur) 

161 The reason Karsey Kongtrul was close to Tsikey goes back to the trouble on the border 
between Tibet and China that had forced the Karmapa to detour to Nangchen instead 
of going to Derge. Because of this dispute, Karsey Kongtrul was forced to flee Palpung. 
After a while, the political situation quieted down. In my monastery, we only heard 
news about fighting between the various factions over in China. At one point, we heard 
that the communists had been defeated and had withdrawn their soldiers from Kham. 
It was to be several years before another upheaval would begin. During this lull, Karsey 
Kongtrui, who had beeo staying at Tsikey, was able to return to Palpung. Prior to his 
arrival at Tsikey, Karsey Kongtrul had gone to Riwoche monastery and from there the 
Chokling of Tsikey now Invited him to his monastery at Konchok Paldron's urging. 
Karsey Kongtrul stayed there for three weeks. Tsikey Chokling was ill as well and stayed 
next to the monastery at his house, which was called Norbu Ling, Jewel Sanctuary.

163 I feel uncomfortable including this private conversation in a book because not only 
would it be out of character for Samten Gyatso, but some people might think that we 
were only bragging about our own family. [tur) 

164 In an unrecorded conversation, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche told me that approaching the 
representative of the Chinese emperor was no simple matter-if he felt you were wast-

the Buddha's teachings. [tur] 

166 It is interesting to note that most tertons have similar visions when they visit this pure 
land; in fact, they often see the exact same details. [tur] 

167 To a person brought up in the materialistic-nihilistic world view it is hard enough to 
be open-minded to the idea of rebirth, and now we hear of someone being an incarna-

explained that an Incarnation of a tulku is like the reflection of the moon in the surface 
of water and several reflections can easily appear In the same pool. [epk]

171 About •fourfold confidence,· let me quote Tsele Natsok Rangdrol, Circle of the Sun 

(Rangjung Yeshe Publications, 1990): •practitioners who have perfected the four visions 
[in Dzogchen) also attain the fourfold confidence of liberation. There are two types of 
downward-directed confidence. The first is confidence free from dread, hence one is 
beyond intimidation by anything whatsoever, such as danger or the hellish sufferings of 
heat and cold. The second is confidence free from fear of wandering into the birthplaces 
of the six classes of beings and through the three realms of samsara. There are two 
types of upward-directed confidence. There is confidence free from fascination with 
the qualities ofbuddhahood and the happiness of the buddhafields and so forth, and the 
confidence free from expectation, which means not having the hope or desire to achieve 
the reward of nirvana. These four types of confidence result from having resolved that 
all of samsara and nirvana is self-cognizance beyond concepts!' Self-cognizance beyond 
concepts refers to our basic state of being, the buddha-nature. [epk] 

m From the Mahayana and Vajrayana perspective-and this makes the story more amus-
ing-the hell realms are not real, physical locations but resemble horror movies played 
out in the minds of the beings there. [epk]

particular guardians of the teachings and are often given only to lineage holders. [epk] 
177 The •warm breath of the dakirus· is a metaphor for effective teachings through an unim-

paired. short lineage. Between Padmasambhava and Samten Gyatso were only two other 
masters: Chokgyur Ungpa and one of the lineage holders from whom Samten Gyatso re-
ceived a particular empowerment, for instance Tsewang Norbu or Karmey Khenpo. [epk)

178 The Indian master Khunu Rinpoche related to Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche that he had also 
received the Lamrim Yeshe Nyingpo from Jamdrak this way. [epk] 

179 Jokyab Rinpoche was born in the Gegyal district. He was the son of a government of-
ficial in an important family. From an early age, he had sincere interest in following a 
spiritual path and was allowed to go to Gebchak Gompa, where he became a disciple 
of Lama Wangdor, who gave him teachings on the Guhyagarbha Tantra. After gaining 
some sound understanding. he became a monk at Dilyak Gompa, where he studied 
with a disciple of the great Karmey Khenpo. At some point, he met Samtcn Gyatso, 
from whom he received the complete New Treasures. He also told me that he received 
some key instructions from Kyungtrul Rinpoche. [tur] 

180 Thanks to Jokyab's tenacity and commitment, we have Jamdrak's learned commentary 
recorded as a complete volume. Today it's a vital aid to understanding the full depth 
of the Light of Wzsdom; it can be found in the English version in the form of extensive 
endnotes to the main text. It's hard to say why Jamdrak delayed so long in giving the 
teachings. Maybe he was testing the sincerity of these students. [epk] 

111 This was likely in 1931-32 when the Mongolian warlord Ma Pu-Fang attacked Nangchen 
see pp. 221-2 in Goldstein. [mt] 

112 This ritual involving the ·summoning of life force· can be based on Buddha Arnitayus, 
his consort Chandali or one of the many other deities for longevity. [cpk] 

113 It was the same in the palace of the Derge king, in whose presence only lamas such as 
the great Situ or the Karmapa were welcome, and probably not that many others. [tur] 

114 It is thought that one's personality relates to the elemental properties: the earth type is 
stable, water is flexible, fire volatile, wind swift, and space accommodating. 

115 The title •Jord of the teachings• refers to the head of a lineage or monastery. [epk] 
186 Prior to this time, there was not one single complete collection of Chokgyur Lingpa's 

terma revelations. The great terton on many occasions had immediately handed the 
treasure-consisting of a statue, sacred substances or decoded scripts from the celes-
tial dakinis-to one of the prophesied recipients, who would become the main lineage 
holder of that particular terma. In Samten Gyatso's youth, around the turn of the centu-
ry, thirty years had already gone by since the great master's passing, and during this time 
some of the lineages had spread far and wide, while others were almost nonexistent. In 
those days, Nangchen had neither transportation nor any modern means of communi-
cation, and Samten Gyatso began a treasure hunt in the most meaningful sense of the 
word. These days the collection consists of more than forty huge volumes. [epk] 

117 An entrustment to the guardians of a terma teaching involves confirming the master's 
position as 'lord of the mandala' and then placing the particular guardian in his service. 
The protector of these teachings is then supposed to carry out the master's noble wishe~ 
and activities. [epk] 

111 After having practiced a sadhana for a specific amount of time or a particular number of 
recitations, the practitioner can make use of certain applications, such as the prepara-
tion of sacred substances to carry out various activities to protect and serve the living 
and the dead. [epk]

193 Great practitioners are in complete control over their mental state when they pass away. 
There is never any anxiety as with ordinary people because changing bodies ls like 
changing clothes for them. Some can even determine how and in what circumstances 
they will expire. Sam ten Gyatso chose the moment of his passing to coincide with those 
last poignant lines. Remaining in samadhi-an extraordinary state of meditative stabil-
ity-after exhaling their last breath is a phenomenon often seen in high lamas and ad-
vanced Buddhist practitioners. This state, known as tukdam, ls characterized by some 
warmth around the heart, the skin not fading or discoloring, no onset of rigor mortis 
and the body remaining in an upright sitting posture. It can last from several hours to a 
week or more. [epk) 

IH When the funeral stupa was opened after Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche's own cremation, his

years practicing. I am told he attained a very high level of realization. (tur] 

197 Do tertons require the Karmapa's approval? Not necessarily, but Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche 
once mentioned that their benefit for beings greatly increases when validated by a 
Karmapa because the Karmapa incarnations represent the activity of enlightenment.

191 A manual is a concatenation of the tantric root text, explanations, notes to the vajra

an elaborate collection of teachings, as well as being incredibly profound in depth and 
scope. Each section has many parts, both sadhanas and instructions. Today the 1hree 
Sections till more than two large volumes. See Appendix 1 for more details. [epk]

199 While Dudjom was there, he received some reading transmissions and instructions from 
Kyungtrul on three major tantric scriptures of the New Schools; from Jam pal Tsultrim 
he requested some of the more important parts of Khakyab Dorje's collected works, 
and from Samten Gyatso he requested the complete version of the 1hree Sections of the 
Great Perfection, but it seems he only received the first three empowerments. [tur] 

200 One day, Dudjom asked to be excused and left. So while Samten Gyatso bestowed the 
remaining empowerments, Kyungtrul continued laboriously composing the arrange-
ments. At some point, it became clear they would not be able to complete the whole 
thing in this way. So as Samten Gyatso had to return to Kham, he stopped the empow-
erments and Kyungtrul stopped working on the text. [tur] 

201 He was referring to a saying common among the people living at Tsurphu that if you 
stay only a day, you'll want to leave, but if you stay a year, you'll never want to. The 
Khampas who come there find it difficult when they first arrive; it's hard to find anyone 
who will even give you the time of day. [tur] 

202 This is no small event: the Treasury of Precious Termas consists of sixty-three large 
volumes full of empowerments and profound instructions. The transmission of these 
teachings can take anywhere between three and six months, depending on the master, 
the number of recipients and the level of detail. It may also be interspersed with group 
practices and therefore may take even longer. [epk) 

203 The Collected Nyingma Tantras in a special annotated edition may be one Tulku Urgyen 
Rinpoche often mentioned as including notes from the Dzogchen master Melong Dorje. 
[epk] 

204 What makes the remark even more amusing is that the name of Samten Gyatso's her-
mitage-the Mansion of Lotus Light-is also the name of Padmasambhava's celestial 
palace. [epk] 

205 Obviously, Kyungtrul was not referring to physical space but rather the basic space that 
is the very nature of awareness already and transcends dimensions. [tur] 

206 Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche once explained that Kyungtrul's teaching style was to include 
profound meditation instructions in stories about the lives of past masters. [epk] 

2ff1 These three young prodigies were receiving teachings in philosophy from the great 
master Tutob Namgyal. During this time, there were six major monastic centers for the 
Nyingma tradition in Tibet: Shechen and Dzogchen in lower Kham, Katok and Palyul 
in the middle, and Dorje Drag and Mindrolling in upper Tibet. While Tutob Namgyal 
was in charge of higher studies at Shechen monastery in Kham, Khyentse, Kongtrul and 
Paltrul were classmates. Khyentse was nobility from the influential Dilgo clan, which in-
cluded a line of ministers in charge of one quarter of the Derge kingdom. Kongtrul was 
born into the Kyungpo clan, the same as Milarepa and Kyungpo Naljor, the founder of 
the Shangpa Kagyil school. The Kyungpo clan included both Buddhists and Bonpos, as 
shown by one of Jamgon Kongtrul's aliases: Chimey Tennyi Yungdrung Lingpa, which 
has a Bonpo connotation. Later Paltrul departed for the district of Dzachukha, while 
Kongtrul went to reside at the great Kagyil monastery Palpung. [tur) 
Yungdrung is often used by Bonpos as the equivalent for vajra. [epk)

210 The •teachings of the ultim:1te transmission• refer to Mahamudra and Dzogchen, espe-
cially a type known as Essence Mahamudra-the transmission of the wisdom lineage, 
so vital in ensuring the purity of Buddhist practice. When receiving the pointing-out 
instruction the disciple is brought face to face with the innate nature of his mind-as 
have all the masters in the lineage before him. You can compare such an experience of 
nondual awareness with daybreak on a cloudless sky: the clouds of ignorance, emotions 
and conceptual thinking are absent-at least for a short while. Once this is experienced, 
ahead of the practitioner now lies the path of growing ever more familiar with this 
cloudless sky-a steady and repeated training in dissolving the tendencies to recreate 
further clouds-until one reaches true realization, a state that is compared to the un-
changing sky itself. [epk)

212 Near the end of his life, Tendzin Dorje gave a young woman a necklace of precious 
stones, a considerable gift, with the remark, ·one day I may come to visit you in your 
house:' The young woman blushed with embarrassment and didn't know what to think. 
Not long after she was informed by messengers from the sixteenth Karmapa that the 
child she was carrying was the tulku ofTendzin Dorje. The woman was Kunsang Dechen 
and the child, her first-born, is Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche. [epk) 

213 Today, in 2005, we know that both Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and Tulku Urgyen 
Rinpoche began to give the empowerments for the Three Sections to smaller groups of 
tulkus and close disciples; in this way, they both mark the third generation of lineage 
holders. [epk) 

m Dzongsar Khyentse was originally known as Katok Khyentse, but after he was invited 
to reside at Dzongsar monastery, eventually he assumed the position of Lord of the 
Dharma. He was known to be like the great Khyentse in person, and his fame spread far 
and wide. [tur) 

215 The fifteenth Karmapa was the immediate reincarnation of Tekchok Dorje. There had 
been a mutual link of teachings between Tekchok Dorje and Chokgyur Lingpa. Several 
generations later, Tekchok Dorje's reincarnation as the fifteenth Karmapa, Khakyab 
Dorje, was again closely connected to my guru and uncle, Samten Gyatso. So it seems 
this connection was about to continue. [tur)

223 Loter Wangpo was a lama from the great Ngor monastery in the Tsang province of 
Centra11ibet. He was one of the principal disciples of both Khyentse and Kongtrul and 
reached the level of indivisible realization through them. He requested many important 
teachings and was a great master of outstanding importance. He was educated in the 
Sakya lineage when young, but he was really nonsectarian. Despite being chiefly Sakya, 
he was the compiler of two colleetions-Drubtab Kuntu and Gyudey Kuntu-contain-
ing tantric teachings from all the Sarma schools, which he supervised in accordance 
with the advice ofKhyentse and Kongtrul. [tur] 

224 1his is why he was sometimes called Shechen I<hyentse [tur]

ings. Today these teachings are known as Kusum Rigdu Zabtik, the Profound Essence 
Embodying the Families of the Three Kayas, and the sadhana practice is the Sphere oj 
Great Bliss. These words appear at the end of the sadhana text where Old Kongtrul 
writes: •pema Osel Do-Ngak Lingpa (Old Khyentse)-the great monarch of all the 
vidyadhara tertons and siddhas-had on the fifteenth day of the eleventh month of 
the year of the Iron Horse, a vision in which he personally received-in the Lotus-
Covered Buddhafield-from Bodhisattva Lotus-Sprout, indivisible from the great 
treasure revealer Chokgyur Lingpa-the nectar-like transmission of the sadhana, 
empowerment and instructions. For one month he kept the samaya seal of secrecy. 
Then, on the tenth day of the twelfth month, they were established in writing in com-
bination with a feast offering, the task which 1-Chimey Tennyi Yungdrung Lingpa 
Tsal (Old Kongtrul), a fortunate disciple of both great vidyadharas-undertook with 
deep respect. At this time the entire ground outside was suddenly warmed up, so 
that the ice and snow melted into a river, an auspicious sign which was visible to eve-
ryone. Since also the few connecting passages of this sadhana are written according 
to the Lord Guru's command, may this cause whoever connects with it to attain the 
state of being indivisible from these two vidyadhara masters' three secrets and may 
it cause the teachings to flourish and remain for a long time! May virtuous goodness 
increase!· [epk] 

226 This was a very large assembly hall where the large golden stupa containing Chokgyur 
Lingpa's remains were kept. This stupa was made using the gold that Chokgyur Lingpa 
had found from a terma; it had an unusual brilliance to it. [tur]

234 The empowerment to master the display of awareness is a most profound transmis-
sion; it brings the disciple face to face with the nature of nondual knowing after which 
the training is to realize that thoughts and emotions are the display of this awareness. 
[epk] 

235 A "seal of secrecy" often restricts a terma's propagation to masters who will be holders 
of that particular lineage, or to people who pledge to practice it wholeheartedly. [epk] 

236 To explain this empowerment, let me quote Padmasambhava: "The empowerment 
for the awareness-display is taught by the buddhas who are by nature spontaneous-
ly perfected and, sending out compassionate emanations from the dharmadhatu of 
Akanishtha, they teach it for the sake of awakening instantaneously the people who are 
of the highest fortune. It is therefore not possible to attain buddhahood without having 
received the empowerment for the awareness-display. All the buddhas of the past awak-
ened after receiving the empowerment for awareness-display. Everyone who presently 
attains enlightenment also awaken after receiving the empowerment for awareness-dis-
play. And, every buddha who attains enlightenment in future times will awaken as well 
after having received the empowerment for awareness-display. It is impossible to attain 
enlightenment unless you have obtained this~ [epk]

238 Chokgyur Lingpa revealed and decoded several tantras. Some are among the treasures 
known as the Sevenfold Cycle of Profundity. He also brought forth a tantra as profound 
as the Guhyagarbha. Sadhanas, of course, are plentiful, but extremely rare is the terton 
who lands a tantra of this type. But our tulku did so, together with the cycle on the Eight 
Consorts! lturl

cycle of teachings on the nine dakinis that are the protectors of basic space. In essence, 
these dakinis are identical with the eight consorts who manifested as guardians of the 
Dzogchen teachings. In this way, you could say that the essence of these teachings is still 
intact. The male aspect is present in the form of many sadhanas, but because that one 
text was lost, the female aspect is now only found in the form of Dharma protectors of 
Ati Yoga. [tur]

the Sakya, Kagyii and Nyingma schools were invited to participate in Tibetan polity. In

ment The vajra throne in Bodhgaya is an external version of the inner throne of basic 
space. In Kham, everyone had heard that when the deceased's spirit flounders through 
the bardo, there are only two places it cannot choose to go: the mother's womb and the 
vajra throne. But Samten Gyatso once told me, •rt's not the throne in Bodhgaya, it's the 
vajra throne of inner basic space, the awakened state of primordial purity. After concep-
tion, you can't come and go from the mother's womb. You can only go in once, then you 
stick like a fly in glue and the spirit begins to be enveloped in a body composed of the 
aggregates, elements, and sense bases, from which there is no escape until the death of 
that rebirth.• [tur)

described as the custodians of the terma teachings. [epk] 

251 Some of these very Important Dzogchen treasures included Tawa Long-Yang. the Vast 
Expanse of the View, revealed by Dorje Lingpa, and Rigdzin Godem's Samantabhadra's 
Realization Directly Revealed. Dzogchen teachings were also revealed by JatsOn 
Nyingpo. Dzongsar Khyentse also mentioned, ·The chief termas throughout all these 
centuries were revealed by the three eminent tertons: Nyang-Ral Nyima Czer, Guru 
Chowang. and Rigdzin Godem, 'the vidyadhara with vulture feathers:" [tur) 

252 Dzongsar Khyentse added, ·Guru Chowang's Tenth Day Practice in Eight Chapters is 
based on the form of Padmasambhava known as Lama Sangdu, the 'master who em-
bodies all secrets: There were three major versions of the Eight Sadhana Teachings. 
Among all the various dakini practices, Nyang-Ral's black wrathful form ofVajra Yogin! 
is extremely profound. 

·or the major collections of termas, Padmasambhava codified three main sets, 
each under the name Gongdii: Lama GongdU. Yulam GongdU. and Khandro Gongdu; 
he then supplemented these with the ChOkyong Gongdu. Sangye Lingpa received the 
mandate for receiving Lama Gongdu, Taksham Lingpa revealed the Yulam GongdU. 
and Chokgyur Lingpa had the mandate to reveal the Khandro GongdU. But the right 
coincidence wasn't formed and he became unable to reveal them; otherwise they would 
have filled quite a few volumes. It is the same for the Chokyong GongdU. as all he wrote 
down was a short sadhana. Padmasambhava indicated that the Khandro Gongdu was 
concealed at the White Cliff in present-day Bhutan, but Chokgyur Lingpa was pre-
vented from going there.:" [tur) 

253 Interestingly. these four masters were all from different countries: Padmasambhava from 
Uddiyana, Vairotsana from Tibet, and Vimalamitra from Kashmir, while their guru, Shri 
Singha, was born in China. probably in one of the Central Asian countries beyond the 
Pamir and Karakoram mountain ranges. They all met Shri Singha in Bodhgaya, though 
not at the same time. (epk) 

254 The oral lineage of the Nyingma school, the Kahma, contains aU the nine gradual ve-
hicles of the buddhas, but it emphasizes the three inner tantras. The ninth of these is the 
Ati, which refers to the Dzogchen teachings. (tur] 

The Four Branches of Heart Essence are highly respected and famous under the 
Tibetan name Nyingtig Yabzhi. These two sets of Heart Essence-the Khandro Nyingtig 
of Padmasambhava and the Virna Nyingtig of Vimalamitra-has each a Quintessence 
written by Longchenpa, the Khandro Yangtig and Lama Yangtig. In addition, there is 
the Profound Quintessence (Zabmo Yangtig). Together these are called the Mother and 
Child Heart Essence. [tur] 

Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche mentions these under the famous abbreviation Do, GyU. 
and Sem, short for Dupedo, Gyutril~ and Semde. Dupedo is the main scripture of Anu 
Yoga. GyutrU/ is the main Mahayoga tantra. Semde here refers to the Mind Section of 
Dzogchen Ati Yoga and in this context includes the other two of the Three Sections: the 
Space Section and Instruction Section. [epk) 

255 This Neten Chokling incarnation was Perna Gyurmey. He was recognized by Dzongsar 
Khyentse, who also became his guru. He was the father of Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche, 
Khyentse Yeshe and Dzigar Kongtrul. [epk]

256 These were the two official reincarnations of Chokgyur Lingpa and were commonly 
known after their places of residence-the Tsikey and Neten monasteries. See glossary 
for more details. (epk] 

m For the adept yogi. clairvoyance is an indelible part of the luminosity of deep sleep. (epk] 
251 Since the books were sold to the U.S. Library of Congress preservation project priced 

by volume, each book was made shorter. The result was that the New Treasures came 
to comprise forty or so volumes, rather than the original twenty-four. For example, 
Chokgyur Lingpa's life story was originally included in the volume with the Lamrim 
Yeshe Nyingpo. (tur] 

259 Lama Putse was a disciple of the third Chokling of Neten, the chant leader of the mon-
astery and editor of the New Treasures published in the early nineteen-eighties. He 
knew the contents of the forty seven-hundred-page volumes better than anyone. (epk] 

:Mel The Sun and Moon Cave is located near Melemchi in the Helambhu region (Y"olmo in 
Tibetan), three days walk north of Kathmandu. On the ceiling inside the main cave is a 
very clear design of the sun and moon. (epk] 

261 The important point about the court case is not the details of why, but the unwavering 
steadfastness with which Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche undertook a task out of devotion to 
the Karmapa. For nine years he pursued the case, getting nothing from it but a lot of 
trouble. [mbs] 

:w However, it is now written down thanks to Gyurmey Dorje, the son of the great sid-
dha king Adzom Drukpa, who felt compelled to have it done. The origin of this lin-
eage is Jigmey Lingpa, who at Samye Chimphu had three visions of the wisdom body 
of Longchenpa, the omniscient lord of speech, from which he received the complete 
transmission of Dzogchen. Since then the lineage has been passed on to only one dis-
ciple at a time. This lineage was unique in its profound and extensive nature. Jigmey 
Lingpa's chief disciples were Tradrub and Dodrub. The former of these was Paltrul's lin-
eage master. Paltrul then passed it on to Khenpo Lungtok, whose disciple was Khenpo 
Ngakchung. Another lineage went through the great scholar Zhenga and this particular 
lineage comes through Khenpo Lungtok, who spent around fifteen years at Paltrul's 
feet. Both Mipham and Zhenga were students ofPaltrul. [tur] 

263 Quite a few tulkus and khenpos opened their eyes to this Hearing Lineage from Nyoshul 
Khen after Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche had requested it, especially because it was difficult 
to get as only one person at a time was allowed to receive it. [epk] 

2M This is quite an understatement. According to Soktse Rinpoche, who was his close dis-
ciple, Bomta Khenpo practiced for nine years at one hermitage in Central Tibet, having 
given up every type of extraneous activity. [epk] .

269 After the young Tsikey Chokling's unfortunate demise many years earlier, Tulku Urgyen 

Rinpoche had been given the tal>k by Tsikey monastery-as was tradition-to ask the 
Karmapa about the Tsikey Chokling's whereabouts. When Rigpey Dorje replied that 
the tulku had been reborn as his second son, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche refused to bring 
the news back to Nangchen, being concerned with accusations of nepotism. It was only 
when the Karmapa was visiting Dabzang Rinpoche's monastery in Boudha that he de-
-clared the fact in front of many lamas-Dabzang, Sabchu, Andzin and Tulku Urgyen 
Rinpoches. [epk] 

770 On one occasion, Dzongsar Khyentse visited Fortress Peak to receive some of the remain-
ing New Treasures from Sam ten Gyatso. He stayed there for about a week, and this was 
when he conferred upon Samten Gyatso the extensive empowerment of Padmasattva 
(Perna Nyugu), which Samten Gyatso didn't have. In return. Samten Gyatso gave him 
the short Padmasattva empowerment. [tur] 

271 When I requested a name for my youngest son, Mingyur Rinpoche from the sixteenth 
Karmapa. he simply said, ·He is a noble incarnation.· Situ Rinpoche was His Holiness' 
attendant at the time and he told Rinpoche this son was the reincarnation Yongey 
Mingyur Dorje (whose incarnations had been closely related to the Situ Rinpoches). 
Later, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche indicated that Mingyur Dorje •would be the best choice 
for the tulku of Kangyur Rinpoche; who was the father of Tulku Perna Wangyal. This 
was fine by me as we often see cases of tulkus being 10imultaneous reincarnations of 
several masters, as weU as one master reincarnating in three or five forms. The tulku 
is something much more flexible than a sarnsaric sentient being who takes one rebirth 
after another, and not by their own choice. For instance, Chokgyur Lingpa saw that 
Dabzang Rinpoche was the simultaneous incarnation of Gampopa, Yutok Gonpo and 
Drimey Dashar, one of Padmasambhava's twenty-five disciples. (tur] 

m Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche received this transmission from Neten Chokling, who 
gave it to Katok Situ as well. (epk] 

273 This text, entitled Garland of Gemstones, was composed for the young sixteenth 
Karmapa by Uncle Tersey and Samten Gyatso, together, while using the record writ-
ten by the second Chokling ofTsikey, Konchok Gyurmey Tenpey Gyaltsen.It was later 
annotated with notes about which transmissions the Karmapa received from Karma 
Orgyen (Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche). In other words, it contains the exact details of 
Tulku Urgyen's lineage of the New Treasures. A similar record also entitled Garland 
of Gemstones, listing the lineage received by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, is found in his 
Collected Works, Vol 25, page 219-276. [epk]
